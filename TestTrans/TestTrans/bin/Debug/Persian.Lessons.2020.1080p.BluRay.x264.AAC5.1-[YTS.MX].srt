3
00:00:58,913 --> 00:01:01,033
In your estimate, how many prisoners

4
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:02,743
have passed through the camp,

5
00:01:02,873 --> 00:01:05,033
while you were there?

6
00:01:08,373 --> 00:01:09,783
About...

7
00:01:11,283 --> 00:01:13,243
twenty-five to thirty thousand.

8
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,913
Do you remember somebody?

9
00:01:26,163 --> 00:01:28,413
All the names are listed in the camp's registers.

10
00:01:28,473 --> 00:01:30,033
You can check them.

11
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:33,283
All the archives of your camp

12
00:01:33,453 --> 00:01:37,203
were burned by the Nazis before liberation.

13
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,163
Where did they catch you?

14
00:03:23,873 --> 00:03:25,333
On my way to Switzerland.

15
00:03:26,663 --> 00:03:28,583
You should've gone through Italy.

16
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,663
Maybe.

17
00:03:33,163 --> 00:03:34,533
Where are you from?

18
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,243
Antwerp.

19
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,283
Your father was a jeweler, right?

20
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:41,243
Rabbi.

21
00:03:42,533 --> 00:03:44,033
Do you practice?

22
00:03:44,493 --> 00:03:45,743
Not really.

23
00:03:52,123 --> 00:03:54,493
Hey friend, do you have something to eat?

24
00:03:54,913 --> 00:03:56,283
Only a sandwich.

25
00:03:56,373 --> 00:03:59,033
You're kidding?! Here, let me show you something.

26
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,583
I'll give you this for your sandwich.

27
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:03,833
Thanks, but I don't need it.

28
00:04:04,163 --> 00:04:05,163
Are you crazy?!

29
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:07,663
It's a rarity. A first edition.

30
00:04:08,163 --> 00:04:09,913
It's priceless, worth a thousand sandwiches!

31
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:11,913
I'll exchange it for half of yours.

32
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:13,833
Please...

33
00:04:14,623 --> 00:04:15,533
Do it!

34
00:04:20,913 --> 00:04:22,083
Take it.

35
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:24,123
Thank you!

36
00:04:27,493 --> 00:04:28,913
Where did you get this book?

37
00:04:29,993 --> 00:04:31,603
My landlords left it

38
00:04:31,673 --> 00:04:33,173
when they fled.

39
00:04:33,283 --> 00:04:35,243
I went in and took it.

40
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:38,953
Who is Reza?

41
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:40,913
Their son.

42
00:04:43,913 --> 00:04:45,203
And "Bawbaw"?

43
00:04:45,873 --> 00:04:47,913
It means 'father' in Persian.

44
00:04:50,283 --> 00:04:51,703
"Thou shalt not steal" -

45
00:04:51,903 --> 00:04:53,783
it's one of our Commandments.

46
00:04:54,623 --> 00:04:56,243
The Eighth Commandment –

47
00:04:56,443 --> 00:04:58,193
"Thou shall not steal."

48
00:04:59,703 --> 00:05:02,163
I think we can forget all of them now.

49
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,033
Get out! Off there!

50
00:06:02,453 --> 00:06:03,333
Over there!

51
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,583
- Get out!
- Off you go! Bags there!

52
00:06:05,743 --> 00:06:07,913
- Come on! Come on!
- Get out!

53
00:06:08,163 --> 00:06:09,413
- Get out! Now!
- Move it!

54
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,413
Go!

55
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:11,583
Move!

56
00:06:11,743 --> 00:06:13,083
That's your group.

57
00:06:13,203 --> 00:06:14,583
Go!

58
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,203
All right! Next ones!

59
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,283
Let's go! Get out! Bags there!

60
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:21,233
Let's go! Move it! Quickly!

61
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,913
Move it! Quickly!

62
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:25,213
Put your bags here!

63
00:06:25,493 --> 00:06:26,493
Get out!

64
00:06:27,373 --> 00:06:29,123
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

65
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,703
Bags here!

66
00:06:31,953 --> 00:06:33,083
Thank you kindly!

67
00:06:33,413 --> 00:06:34,243
Come on!

68
00:06:34,703 --> 00:06:35,783
Walk!

69
00:06:36,413 --> 00:06:37,783
Didn't just I say to come?!

70
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:38,413
Quickly!

71
00:06:38,493 --> 00:06:40,163
Go! Now!

72
00:06:41,413 --> 00:06:43,663
Come on, a little faster here!

73
00:06:48,203 --> 00:06:49,913
Form a line!

74
00:06:52,123 --> 00:06:54,663
Turn away! Don't stare at me like that!

75
00:06:57,243 --> 00:06:58,453
Ready!

76
00:06:58,623 --> 00:06:59,373
Fire!

77
00:07:03,783 --> 00:07:05,833
Did you see that? He fell on purpose.

78
00:07:06,203 --> 00:07:07,283
Hey!

79
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:09,623
You thought you could fool us, huh?

80
00:07:09,783 --> 00:07:11,783
I know what I saw – you fell on purpose.

81
00:07:12,123 --> 00:07:13,703
No... No, please!

82
00:07:13,753 --> 00:07:15,083
You think you're smarter than me?

83
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:16,583
I'm not a Jew!

84
00:07:16,743 --> 00:07:17,953
- Get on your knees!
- I'm a Persian!

85
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:18,913
On your knees!!

86
00:07:18,953 --> 00:07:20,123
I'm a Persian!

87
00:07:20,203 --> 00:07:22,203
- Yeah, right!
- What's he saying?!

88
00:07:22,663 --> 00:07:24,083
He says he's Persian.

89
00:07:25,493 --> 00:07:27,283
Don't shoot, don't shoot him, Max!

90
00:07:27,453 --> 00:07:29,093
Why the hell not?

91
00:07:29,203 --> 00:07:31,413
Officer Koch is looking for a Persian.

92
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:32,993
There is even a reward.

93
00:07:33,243 --> 00:07:34,913
And if this one's bullshitting us?

94
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,583
How could he know Koch was looking for a Persian?

95
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,533
Come on! He said the first thing that came into his mind.

96
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:40,533
He's lying.

97
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:43,203
- Huh?! Are you lying?!
- No! I swear!

98
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:45,083
I'm not a Jew!

99
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,283
I'm Persian!

100
00:07:48,703 --> 00:07:49,783
Here!

101
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,333
- Give it here.
- Please...!

102
00:07:59,123 --> 00:08:00,583
- Is this yours?
- Yes!

103
00:08:02,413 --> 00:08:04,313
Come with me!

104
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,873
Paul, it's your ass, if he turns out not to be Persian.

105
00:08:06,913 --> 00:08:08,033
Yeah, yeah.

106
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,333
So what's the reward?

107
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:59,033
Ten cans of meat.

108
00:08:59,283 --> 00:09:00,393
Six for me!

109
00:09:00,453 --> 00:09:01,783
Bullshit! I found him.

110
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:14,163
"TO EACH WHAT HE DESERVES"

111
00:09:14,743 --> 00:09:16,493
This is very sloppy!

112
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,933
I'm sorry, Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer,

113
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:19,103
I tried my best!

114
00:09:19,104 --> 00:09:20,283
No! You did not try your best.

115
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,313
Had you tried your best,

116
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:22,553
the letters would be the same size

117
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:24,703
and the lines would be parallel to each other.

118
00:09:27,413 --> 00:09:29,033
Commandant authorized me

119
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:31,203
to keep the prisoner registers

120
00:09:31,283 --> 00:09:32,453
And you're making a fool of me.

121
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,083
Tell me then - what's this letter?

122
00:09:36,783 --> 00:09:38,163
It's an 'r', Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer.

123
00:09:38,283 --> 00:09:40,453
It's anything but an 'r'!

124
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:44,123
It could be an "n" or it could be a "v"!

125
00:09:44,413 --> 00:09:45,783
It could even be an "x"!

126
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:47,653
That's how I always write my 'r's...

127
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:49,193
Don't talk back to me!!

128
00:09:50,493 --> 00:09:51,873
Do I look like an idiot to you?!

129
00:09:51,993 --> 00:09:53,413
Or do you think I am blind?!

130
00:09:54,453 --> 00:09:57,123
You will write it again!!

131
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:01,583
Un-until I am satisfied with it!

132
00:10:01,913 --> 00:10:02,913
Get out!

133
00:10:06,203 --> 00:10:07,083
Heil Hitler!

134
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,243
Come in!

135
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,783
May we enter, Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer?

136
00:10:29,953 --> 00:10:31,143
No, why don't you stand there

137
00:10:31,343 --> 00:10:32,833
with your head in the door!

138
00:10:32,913 --> 00:10:34,123
I already told you to come in!

139
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:40,493
What do you want?

140
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,243
We've found a Persian.

141
00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:52,583
Bring him in!

142
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,623
How do you know he's a Persian?

143
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:09,913
He told us.

144
00:11:09,993 --> 00:11:11,833
Of course he did. And what if he's lying?

145
00:11:11,993 --> 00:11:13,493
I also said that.

146
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:31,743
Does he speak German?

147
00:11:32,123 --> 00:11:33,333
Seems to.

148
00:11:34,243 --> 00:11:35,493
You're Persian?

149
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:38,583
Half.

150
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,403
My father is Persian and...

151
00:11:41,603 --> 00:11:43,153
my mother is Belgian.

152
00:11:46,783 --> 00:11:48,193
Wait in the hallway.

153
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:07,783
Your name is Reza?

154
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,573
Joon - is your last name?

155
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:30,833
What is this, "Bawbaw"?

156
00:12:31,703 --> 00:12:32,953
Bawbaw...

157
00:12:33,373 --> 00:12:35,993
it means "father" in our language.

158
00:12:44,873 --> 00:12:46,913
What's the capital of Persia?

159
00:12:48,373 --> 00:12:49,533
Teheran.

160
00:12:50,163 --> 00:12:51,873
What language do they speak there?

161
00:12:52,243 --> 00:12:53,123
Farsi.

162
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:59,033
How do you say 'mother'?

163
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:01,033
Mother?

164
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:03,623
Mother. Yes, how do you say 'mother'?

165
00:13:03,663 --> 00:13:05,203
It's the first word a child learns!

166
00:13:05,283 --> 00:13:06,553
Answer right now

167
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:07,893
or I'll have you shot!

168
00:13:08,953 --> 00:13:10,533
"Anta".

169
00:13:16,623 --> 00:13:18,203
Read me something from this.

170
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,663
I can't read or write Farsi.

171
00:13:21,783 --> 00:13:23,083
We only spoke it at home.

172
00:13:23,163 --> 00:13:24,873
Then speak it right now!

173
00:13:50,783 --> 00:13:52,493
What does it mean?

174
00:13:55,243 --> 00:13:56,333
'You...

175
00:13:57,413 --> 00:13:59,743
see the sun slowly setting,

176
00:14:00,663 --> 00:14:02,583
yet you're surprised,

177
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:05,833
when it's suddenly dark.'

178
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:16,873
More than anything in this world,

179
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:18,233
I hate liars...

180
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:19,583
and thieves.

181
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,033
If you're lying to me, you will regret it.

182
00:14:26,243 --> 00:14:27,673
But if you're telling the truth,

183
00:14:27,873 --> 00:14:29,433
consider yourself lucky.

184
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,203
Starting tomorrow, you'll work in the kitchen

185
00:14:33,243 --> 00:14:35,373
and help feed the prisoners.

186
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:38,073
Then after work every day, you'll come

187
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:39,693
and teach me your language.

188
00:14:39,953 --> 00:14:41,663
- Understood?
- Absolutely!

189
00:14:43,163 --> 00:14:44,623
Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer.

190
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,693
Get in here!

191
00:14:57,453 --> 00:15:00,163
Take him to the barracks. For now.

192
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:31,783
Only two?

193
00:15:31,873 --> 00:15:33,413
He first wants to make sure

194
00:15:33,623 --> 00:15:35,283
this guy is a real Persian.

195
00:15:37,123 --> 00:15:38,193
If you don't want it,

196
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:39,873
I'll send it to my family in Hamburg.

197
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:41,783
Fuck your Hamburg! You, come!

198
00:15:42,663 --> 00:15:43,413
Move!

199
00:15:43,953 --> 00:15:44,783
Go, go!

200
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,333
Go! Go!

201
00:15:51,293 --> 00:15:53,013
Get in line!

202
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,013
Throw your things here.

203
00:15:56,293 --> 00:15:58,233
Throw your things here.

204
00:15:58,393 --> 00:15:59,973
Go! Go!

205
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:05,973
Get in line!

206
00:16:15,623 --> 00:16:17,433
Everyone must take a number

207
00:16:17,503 --> 00:16:19,233
and sew it on their chest!

208
00:16:30,203 --> 00:16:31,433
You'll be working here –

209
00:16:31,553 --> 00:16:33,313
in the kitchen that serves officers.

210
00:16:33,453 --> 00:16:35,813
Follow all orders, internal regulations

211
00:16:35,893 --> 00:16:37,333
and rules of hygiene.

212
00:16:37,453 --> 00:16:39,443
All knives and cutting implements

213
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:40,913
are strictly inventoried

214
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,203
They have to be returned to us

215
00:16:42,403 --> 00:16:43,443
and counted every night.

216
00:16:43,783 --> 00:16:45,693
If you breach these rules, you'll be punished.

217
00:16:46,123 --> 00:16:47,703
In case of laziness and poor hygiene,

218
00:16:47,903 --> 00:16:48,913
the offender gets 15 lashes.

219
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,743
In the event of sabotage, theft,

220
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,623
or an attempt to spoil the food - you'll be shot.

221
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,033
Is that clear?

222
00:16:54,283 --> 00:16:56,393
And you must wash your hands every time,

223
00:16:56,593 --> 00:16:58,243
as you enter and leave the kitchen.

224
00:16:58,453 --> 00:16:59,533
Get to work!

225
00:17:27,953 --> 00:17:29,833
I heard there is a dance tonight.

226
00:17:31,663 --> 00:17:32,783
Will you go with me?

227
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,833
Sorry Max. I have other plans.

228
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,073
What plans are those?

229
00:17:38,283 --> 00:17:39,663
What does it matter to you?

230
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:44,333
Not a lot...

231
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,163
I'm just curious.

232
00:17:48,493 --> 00:17:50,413
Anyway, I thought you were after Jana?

233
00:17:52,703 --> 00:17:54,783
Listen, that was just one time.

234
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,873
I... was drunk,

235
00:17:56,953 --> 00:17:58,413
and I was standing next to her.

236
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:01,373
And suddenly she was standing next to me.

237
00:18:02,243 --> 00:18:04,283
She still waits for you, you know?

238
00:18:04,703 --> 00:18:06,283
Curls her hair for you.

239
00:18:06,703 --> 00:18:09,123
Says Max likes girls with curls.

240
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,873
Who knows what I said that night.

241
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:23,623
See that one?

242
00:18:26,453 --> 00:18:28,229
Koch wants him brought to him

243
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,573
after every shift.

244
00:18:29,993 --> 00:18:31,243
Why is that?

245
00:18:32,493 --> 00:18:34,033
He thinks he's a Persian.

246
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:37,583
So? Koch is sweet on Persians?

247
00:18:38,163 --> 00:18:40,703
Koch is not sweet on anyone.

248
00:18:42,493 --> 00:18:44,203
And anyway, this one is no Persian.

249
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:47,243
'Father' – "bawbaw".

250
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:50,083
"Anta" –

251
00:18:50,873 --> 00:18:52,163
'mother'

252
00:18:54,453 --> 00:18:56,123
'Father' – "bawbaw"

253
00:18:56,413 --> 00:18:58,283
"Anta" – 'mother'

254
00:19:00,533 --> 00:19:01,833
I need more.

255
00:19:11,123 --> 00:19:12,413
'Plate' –

256
00:19:13,123 --> 00:19:14,373
"rut"

257
00:19:18,743 --> 00:19:19,913
'Fork' –

258
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,953
"kars"

259
00:19:26,953 --> 00:19:27,993
'Bread' –

260
00:19:30,953 --> 00:19:32,373
"radʒ"

261
00:19:37,413 --> 00:19:38,623
'Spoon' –

262
00:19:40,493 --> 00:19:41,703
"bala"

263
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:43,743
"bala"

264
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,373
'Meat' –

265
00:19:55,743 --> 00:19:57,033
"gank"

266
00:19:57,993 --> 00:19:59,493
'Fish' –

267
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:01,243
"ʧim"

268
00:20:08,243 --> 00:20:09,493
'Plate' –

269
00:20:12,373 --> 00:20:13,493
"rut"

270
00:20:14,373 --> 00:20:15,833
'Fork' –

271
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:18,333
"kars"

272
00:20:19,203 --> 00:20:20,783
'Meat'...

273
00:20:23,033 --> 00:20:23,993
Shit!

274
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,783
"gank... gank"

275
00:20:29,913 --> 00:20:32,283
After the war, I want to go to Teheran.

276
00:20:33,123 --> 00:20:35,373
I want to open a German restaurant there.

277
00:20:37,533 --> 00:20:39,663
They don't eat pork in Iran.

278
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,283
I don't need pork.

279
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:48,453
I can cook anything – lamb, veal, fish.

280
00:20:49,743 --> 00:20:51,143
I started as a kitchen boy

281
00:20:51,143 --> 00:20:52,623
when I was twelve.

282
00:20:52,873 --> 00:20:54,913
Ten years later, I was a master chef.

283
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:56,623
Master chef.

284
00:20:56,743 --> 00:20:59,061
In a restaurant that served

285
00:20:59,062 --> 00:21:01,533
150 guests a night.

286
00:21:02,493 --> 00:21:04,023
Farsi is a complex language,

287
00:21:04,223 --> 00:21:05,533
Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer.

288
00:21:07,033 --> 00:21:08,453
I have no doubt.

289
00:21:10,413 --> 00:21:12,583
Which is why I've devised a plan.

290
00:21:16,283 --> 00:21:19,373
4 words a day amounts to 24 words a week,

291
00:21:19,743 --> 00:21:21,743
96 words a month, and...

292
00:21:21,993 --> 00:21:24,373
1,152 words a year.

293
00:21:25,123 --> 00:21:27,083
The war will last...

294
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,583
a minimum of two more years.

295
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:32,323
That means that by the end of the war,

296
00:21:32,523 --> 00:21:34,283
I should know over 2000 words.

297
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,933
I'm not concerned

298
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:37,213
with reading or writing.

299
00:21:37,273 --> 00:21:38,733
I just need to speak.

300
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,163
Understood?

301
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:42,493
Yes, Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer.

302
00:21:46,163 --> 00:21:47,783
One more thing...

303
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,433
As you can see,

304
00:21:52,513 --> 00:21:54,373
I'm a very kind man,

305
00:21:55,623 --> 00:21:58,283
but I'm not anybody's fool.

306
00:21:59,493 --> 00:22:01,673
If you're not who you claim to be,

307
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:03,733
I will find out and kill you.

308
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,583
Is that understood?

309
00:22:09,743 --> 00:22:12,493
Understood, Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer.

310
00:22:13,913 --> 00:22:15,273
And stop saying 'Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer'

311
00:22:15,353 --> 00:22:16,693
after every sentence.

312
00:22:18,033 --> 00:22:19,083
Yes, sir.

313
00:22:21,453 --> 00:22:22,533
Good.

314
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:25,783
Let's start with the basics.

315
00:22:25,873 --> 00:22:27,683
I need the words

316
00:22:27,753 --> 00:22:29,233
that have to do with food.

317
00:22:30,413 --> 00:22:32,833
For example, how do you say...

318
00:22:33,873 --> 00:22:34,873
'restaurant'?

319
00:22:35,333 --> 00:22:36,553
'Restaurant'?

320
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:38,663
is...

321
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:40,783
"onordan".

322
00:22:42,953 --> 00:22:44,833
"O-nor-dan".

323
00:22:45,033 --> 00:22:46,453
- "Onor-dan"?
- "dan".

324
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,413
Yes. Close enough.

325
00:22:50,993 --> 00:22:52,203
'Bread' –

326
00:22:54,163 --> 00:22:55,033
"rаdʒ".

327
00:22:55,953 --> 00:22:58,413
- "Rаdʒ?"
- "Rаdʒ". Yes.

328
00:22:59,493 --> 00:23:00,743
'Spoon' –

329
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:05,243
"bala".

330
00:23:07,873 --> 00:23:08,703
"Bala"?

331
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:10,583
'Fork' –

332
00:23:12,453 --> 00:23:13,783
"kars".

333
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,163
'Fish' –

334
00:23:18,783 --> 00:23:20,663
- 'Fish'...
- "ʧim".

335
00:23:21,203 --> 00:23:22,913
- "ʧim"?
- "ʧim".

336
00:23:23,203 --> 00:23:24,623
- "ʧim".
- Yeah.

337
00:23:24,833 --> 00:23:25,663
Nice.

338
00:23:26,413 --> 00:23:29,083
Then what is... 'pig'?

339
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:31,413
'Pig'?

340
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:35,663
'Pig'.

341
00:23:36,413 --> 00:23:38,083
"Tsvajn", yes.

342
00:23:42,453 --> 00:23:45,163
"Tsvajn", Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer.

343
00:23:45,953 --> 00:23:47,873
Odd as that may sound...

344
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:58,123
"Rut, ʧim, palʲi, gank, anta, bawbaw,

345
00:23:58,283 --> 00:24:01,333
onordan, tsvajn, rаdʒ, bala, kars,

346
00:24:01,453 --> 00:24:03,533
rut, ʧim, palʲi, gank,

00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,913

palʲi, gank, anta, rаdʒ, gank..."

356
00:24:28,913 --> 00:24:30,163
What are you doing?!

357
00:24:32,743 --> 00:24:33,783
Praying.

358
00:24:34,533 --> 00:24:35,743
Pray quieter!

359
00:24:48,533 --> 00:24:51,333
"rаdʒ, bala, kars, rut, ʧim, bala, gank,

360
00:24:51,663 --> 00:24:53,582

361
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:55,913
rаdʒ, anta, bala, kars, rut, ʧim..."

362
00:24:56,243 --> 00:24:57,743
"Onordan"

363
00:25:01,993 --> 00:25:03,413
"Rut"

364
00:25:07,123 --> 00:25:08,583
"Bala"

365
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:14,743
"Rаdʒ"

366
00:25:17,743 --> 00:25:18,993
"Tsvajn"

367
00:25:24,033 --> 00:25:24,953
Yes!

368
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:31,633
Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer,

369
00:25:31,693 --> 00:25:32,573
I'm Rottenfuhrer Max Beyer.

370
00:25:32,673 --> 00:25:34,493
May I report?

371
00:25:35,453 --> 00:25:36,873
Report.

372
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,503
That prisoner, who claims to be Reza Joon,

373
00:25:44,703 --> 00:25:45,733
is lying to you.

374
00:25:46,333 --> 00:25:47,533
He's not a Persian.

375
00:25:48,203 --> 00:25:49,333
Is that so?

376
00:25:49,993 --> 00:25:51,033
Yes.

377
00:25:52,873 --> 00:25:55,623
And what led you to this assumption, Beyer?

378
00:25:57,163 --> 00:25:58,993
Well, I checked him again.

379
00:26:00,163 --> 00:26:01,623
And...

380
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:04,993
Not only does the man look like a Jew,

381
00:26:05,373 --> 00:26:07,873
his hands are of a Jew, his nose is of a Jew,

382
00:26:07,993 --> 00:26:09,413
the back of his head is of a Jew,

383
00:26:09,783 --> 00:26:11,833
he even stinks like a Jew.

384
00:26:13,913 --> 00:26:16,623
You imagine you're smarter than me?

385
00:26:18,373 --> 00:26:19,873
No, of course not.

386
00:26:20,373 --> 00:26:21,913
I just wanted to warn you...

387
00:26:21,953 --> 00:26:23,413
About something you're incapable

388
00:26:23,493 --> 00:26:25,033
to comprehend yourself.

389
00:26:30,993 --> 00:26:33,373
I may not yet know, if he's telling the truth,

390
00:26:33,533 --> 00:26:35,783
but I doubt that you know any better.

391
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:41,113
With all due respect, Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer,

392
00:26:41,173 --> 00:26:43,243
I know that pack of Zionists all too well.

393
00:26:43,453 --> 00:26:45,123
There were a few of them in my town –

394
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:46,833
and they're crafty like rats.

395
00:26:47,453 --> 00:26:48,803
He'll pretend to be Chinese,

396
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,313
if he has to.

397
00:26:50,453 --> 00:26:52,153
Just to make a fool of you.

398
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:55,373
To make a fool of me?

399
00:26:56,623 --> 00:26:59,413
Listen you, Jew-expert.

400
00:27:01,243 --> 00:27:02,833
You took my canned meat,

401
00:27:02,913 --> 00:27:03,993
and now you come

402
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,193
and tell me he is not Persian.

403
00:27:06,493 --> 00:27:07,993
Where's the logic?

404
00:27:11,783 --> 00:27:15,533
Let the Persian be my concern, Rottenfuhrer.

405
00:27:16,453 --> 00:27:17,583
Dismissed.

406
00:27:36,203 --> 00:27:38,733
I decided to remove you from your duties,

407
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:39,913
Helferin Strumpf.

408
00:27:40,703 --> 00:27:43,373
Your handwriting leaves much to be desired.

409
00:27:44,623 --> 00:27:46,193
The Persian will keep

410
00:27:46,293 --> 00:27:47,633
the logs now.

411
00:27:47,783 --> 00:27:49,733
- But...
- But what?!

412
00:27:50,953 --> 00:27:52,283
Dismissed!

413
00:28:01,493 --> 00:28:02,743
Show me your hands.

414
00:28:05,663 --> 00:28:06,743
They're dirty.

415
00:28:07,793 --> 00:28:10,283
You know that they must always be clean!

416
00:28:11,913 --> 00:28:13,333
Go and wash them!

417
00:28:14,533 --> 00:28:15,743
What are you staring at?

418
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,053
Get to work!

419
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:21,913
Persian!

420
00:28:23,663 --> 00:28:24,733
Persian!

421
00:28:33,283 --> 00:28:35,493
Translate these forty words into Farsi.

422
00:28:36,453 --> 00:28:37,413
Forty?

423
00:28:37,993 --> 00:28:39,033
I thought – four words a day...

424
00:28:39,123 --> 00:28:40,243
No, forty.

425
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:42,623
I need to make up for lost time.

426
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:47,703
Is there a problem?

427
00:28:49,703 --> 00:28:52,243
There are only thirty-nine words.

428
00:28:55,413 --> 00:28:56,783
Is that important?

429
00:28:57,243 --> 00:28:58,913
Add another one.

430
00:28:59,703 --> 00:29:01,083
Which one?

431
00:29:02,243 --> 00:29:03,693
Any one.

432
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:07,373
How about 'truth'?

433
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,243
I don't have a pencil.

434
00:29:32,623 --> 00:29:34,533
I want you in my office after your shift.

435
00:29:34,623 --> 00:29:36,663
Have them translated by then.

436
00:29:37,623 --> 00:29:39,243
Absolutely, Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer.

437
00:29:40,493 --> 00:29:41,993
May I take a pencil?

438
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:43,473
No.

439
00:29:43,913 --> 00:29:46,903
You'll say the words, and I'll write them down.

440
00:30:08,913 --> 00:30:10,493
Thank you.

441
00:30:13,663 --> 00:30:14,583
Is this place free?

442
00:30:18,493 --> 00:30:20,283
I see you're in a bad mood.

443
00:30:21,203 --> 00:30:22,243
Leave me alone.

444
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:24,413
Why? Maybe I can help.

445
00:30:25,203 --> 00:30:26,743
You can't.

446
00:30:31,123 --> 00:30:33,373
Let me guess, you're unhappy in love.

447
00:30:33,703 --> 00:30:35,703
I don't give a damn about love!

448
00:30:38,453 --> 00:30:39,783
Then why are you so upset?

449
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,733
Koch dismissed me from writing the prisoner logs,

450
00:30:43,813 --> 00:30:45,293
and replaced me with the Persian.

451
00:30:47,203 --> 00:30:48,413
Are you sure it's the only reason?

452
00:30:48,493 --> 00:30:49,913
Yes, goddamnit!

453
00:30:50,243 --> 00:30:52,283
I happen to like writing lists in a quiet office

454
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:54,783
more than watching over those dirty Jews in the kitchen!

455
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:55,873
Including your Persian!

456
00:30:56,953 --> 00:30:59,783
He's not a Persian, and he's not mine.

457
00:31:00,413 --> 00:31:02,243
And I'm working on getting rid of him.

458
00:31:02,993 --> 00:31:03,993
How?

459
00:31:06,123 --> 00:31:07,633
I could kill him,

460
00:31:07,763 --> 00:31:08,973
but if Koch found out...

461
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:10,833
What if he escapes?

462
00:31:12,163 --> 00:31:13,873
Then he'll die for sure.

463
00:31:13,993 --> 00:31:15,493
That's what I mean.

464
00:31:39,123 --> 00:31:41,533
You go back to your post.

465
00:32:05,493 --> 00:32:06,703
Go on!

466
00:32:38,703 --> 00:32:40,053
Hey, shorty!

467
00:32:42,453 --> 00:32:43,783
Come here!

468
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:54,913
Put your hands down.

469
00:33:06,703 --> 00:33:08,663
Where do you think you're going?

470
00:33:09,203 --> 00:33:10,663
There is a minefield there

471
00:33:10,753 --> 00:33:12,123
and a swamp over there.

472
00:33:12,203 --> 00:33:14,053
So, if you don't blow up,

473
00:33:14,153 --> 00:33:15,913
you'll sink.

474
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:20,473
Anyway, they'll track you with dogs.

475
00:33:21,203 --> 00:33:22,743
Here, sit down.

476
00:33:31,493 --> 00:33:32,913
Sit down.

477
00:33:44,703 --> 00:33:46,783
If I were you, I'd go back.

478
00:33:46,993 --> 00:33:49,533
I can't, I'll die there too.

479
00:33:53,193 --> 00:33:55,053
That's true.

480
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,593
I'm supposed to invent forty words

481
00:33:58,673 --> 00:34:00,283
in a language I don't know.

482
00:34:00,623 --> 00:34:02,083
Which one?

483
00:34:03,453 --> 00:34:04,663
Farsi.

484
00:34:06,533 --> 00:34:08,283
F-farsi?

485
00:34:09,413 --> 00:34:10,833
Persian.

486
00:34:16,663 --> 00:34:18,783
Inventing them is not a problem,

487
00:34:19,703 --> 00:34:21,623
but to remember them all...

488
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:24,993
it's impossible.

489
00:34:26,913 --> 00:34:28,993
And there will always be more.

490
00:34:29,373 --> 00:34:31,203
Many more.

491
00:34:44,703 --> 00:34:46,373
Here you are.

492
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:49,083
Go get him.

493
00:34:59,953 --> 00:35:03,123
I would hurry. It won't take them long.

494
00:35:26,203 --> 00:35:28,163
To your health!

495
00:35:45,993 --> 00:35:47,223
I was sure

496
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:49,373
that bastard would be hiding here!

497
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,533
Stop!

498
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:07,783
On the ground!

499
00:36:09,583 --> 00:36:10,533
Don't move!

500
00:36:12,493 --> 00:36:14,373
I was taking out the garbage.

501
00:36:16,243 --> 00:36:18,163
I was just taking out the garbage.

502
00:36:22,783 --> 00:36:24,333
Where is the Persian?

503
00:36:24,493 --> 00:36:26,023
He went to take out the slop,

504
00:36:26,093 --> 00:36:27,283
Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer.

505
00:36:27,533 --> 00:36:29,283
He's been gone a long time.

506
00:36:35,373 --> 00:36:36,913
Where have you been?

507
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:39,413
Come on.

508
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:47,663
Heil Hitler!

509
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:02,873
How's your penmanship?

510
00:37:04,913 --> 00:37:06,743
Adequate, I think.

511
00:37:06,873 --> 00:37:08,033
Sit down.

512
00:37:11,163 --> 00:37:12,893
These are the lists of the new arrivals.

513
00:37:12,973 --> 00:37:14,633
They need to be written into this register.

514
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,703
But, neatly and orderly.

515
00:37:16,953 --> 00:37:18,373
Can you do that?

516
00:37:21,283 --> 00:37:22,833
And the crossed out ones?

517
00:37:23,273 --> 00:37:24,473
Those died en route.

518
00:37:24,553 --> 00:37:26,173
Don't write them in.

519
00:37:30,413 --> 00:37:31,953
No! Wait!

520
00:37:33,533 --> 00:37:35,243
First the margin lines,

521
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:38,533
place of birth, their number,

522
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:41,083
then their name and date of birth.

523
00:37:42,283 --> 00:37:43,753
You have...

524
00:37:44,833 --> 00:37:46,243
three quarters of an hour.

525
00:37:46,583 --> 00:37:48,253
But take your time

526
00:37:48,953 --> 00:37:50,703
and make sure it's done properly.

527
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:54,093
And don't forget the 40 words.

528
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:55,603
We'll get to them

529
00:37:55,693 --> 00:37:57,193
after you finish the lists.

530
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:55,093
'I' – Gilles – "Ilʲ"

531
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:58,113
'You' – Klaus – "au"

532
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:01,953
'Brother' –

533
00:40:02,993 --> 00:40:04,413
Hillel...

534
00:40:06,413 --> 00:40:07,743
"khilʲ"

535
00:40:09,453 --> 00:40:10,783
'East' –

536
00:40:11,953 --> 00:40:13,333
Fabio...

537
00:40:17,743 --> 00:40:19,083
"fab"

538
00:40:21,993 --> 00:40:23,163
'No' –

539
00:40:23,453 --> 00:40:24,493
Mark...

540
00:40:27,243 --> 00:40:28,203
"ma"

541
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:29,913
'Shit' –

542
00:40:30,623 --> 00:40:32,133
"ard"

543
00:40:34,783 --> 00:40:38,123
"ar... d, ard"

544
00:40:39,663 --> 00:40:41,313
'Death' –

545
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:45,373
Max...

546
00:40:47,283 --> 00:40:48,623
"ax"

547
00:41:10,243 --> 00:41:11,743
How goes the work?

548
00:41:12,163 --> 00:41:13,413
Good.

549
00:41:20,453 --> 00:41:21,623
Good.

550
00:41:23,203 --> 00:41:24,893
May I go then?

551
00:41:27,783 --> 00:41:29,703
Have you forgotten something?

552
00:41:30,743 --> 00:41:31,833
No.

553
00:41:33,283 --> 00:41:34,623
Here are the words.

554
00:41:48,413 --> 00:41:49,623
'I'?

555
00:41:50,413 --> 00:41:51,583
"Il"

556
00:41:51,783 --> 00:41:53,613
- "Ilʲ".
- "Ilʲ".

557
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:55,083
'You'?

558
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:56,533
- "Au".
- "Au".

559
00:41:57,283 --> 00:41:59,123
"Ilʲ, au."

560
00:42:01,663 --> 00:42:02,833
'Brother'?

561
00:42:03,663 --> 00:42:04,413
"Shil"?

562
00:42:04,453 --> 00:42:05,203
"Khilʲ"

563
00:42:05,283 --> 00:42:07,373
- "Khilʲ"?
- "Khilʲ".

564
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:09,893
Say all of these aloud.

565
00:42:09,993 --> 00:42:11,393
I need to know how

566
00:42:11,473 --> 00:42:12,793
to pronounce them.

567
00:42:13,413 --> 00:42:14,413
'East' –

568
00:42:16,953 --> 00:42:18,333
- "Fab".
- "Fab".

569
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:20,533
'No' –

570
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:22,743
"Ma".

571
00:42:23,203 --> 00:42:25,783
- 'Shit'.
- "Ard".

572
00:42:25,913 --> 00:42:27,163
"Ard".

573
00:42:28,453 --> 00:42:29,413
'Death'?

574
00:42:30,033 --> 00:42:32,083
- "Ax".
– "Ax".

575
00:42:32,703 --> 00:42:34,083
"Ax".

576
00:42:34,413 --> 00:42:36,833
- 'Small'.
- "Ri".

577
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:39,243
"Ri..." Rolled "r"?

578
00:42:39,453 --> 00:42:40,333
Yes.

579
00:42:40,453 --> 00:42:42,083
- Rrr.
- "Rr...".

580
00:42:42,243 --> 00:42:43,583
- "Ri".
- "Ri".

581
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:47,533
'Big'?

582
00:42:48,663 --> 00:42:50,283
"Tus".

583
00:42:51,453 --> 00:42:53,533
Good. That's enough for now.

584
00:42:54,663 --> 00:42:55,993
Now I have a lot to learn.

585
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,623
You may go.

586
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:11,203
"Ilʲ"

587
00:43:13,373 --> 00:43:14,453
Jean.

588
00:43:16,413 --> 00:43:17,583
Patrice.

589
00:43:21,123 --> 00:43:22,493
Claude.

590
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:31,743
Andre.

591
00:43:37,203 --> 00:43:38,273
Pierre.

592
00:43:44,743 --> 00:43:46,083
Olivier.

593
00:43:50,873 --> 00:43:52,083
Michel.

594
00:43:54,413 --> 00:43:55,583
"on"

595
00:43:56,703 --> 00:43:57,783
"is"

596
00:43:58,743 --> 00:43:59,783
"lod"

597
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:01,873
"drэ"

598
00:44:02,953 --> 00:44:04,033
"er"

599
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:06,123
"liv"

600
00:44:07,283 --> 00:44:08,533
"ʃelʲ"

601
00:44:09,993 --> 00:44:12,163
"ari, nar, na,

602
00:44:13,033 --> 00:44:14,783
ælʲ, isi,

603
00:44:17,743 --> 00:44:19,373
sent, selʲ,

604
00:44:19,703 --> 00:44:21,703
ofi, lʲeri, li,

605
00:44:22,833 --> 00:44:23,833
ʃelʲ,

606
00:44:24,533 --> 00:44:26,033
dje, ri"

607
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:42,833
Heil Hitler!

608
00:44:43,493 --> 00:44:44,913
The Commandant wanted to speak with me.

609
00:44:45,123 --> 00:44:46,913
Yes, he is waiting for you.

610
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:51,333
Enter!

611
00:44:56,413 --> 00:44:57,333
Heil Hitler!

612
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:07,623
I wanted to ask you...

613
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:11,873
How's your Persian language coming along?

614
00:45:12,033 --> 00:45:13,333
Good.

615
00:45:13,453 --> 00:45:17,553
I've learned 570 words in the past six months.

616
00:45:17,993 --> 00:45:19,783
Extremely impressive!

617
00:45:20,203 --> 00:45:22,933
Why, may I ask, did you choose

618
00:45:23,013 --> 00:45:25,993
such an exotic language?

619
00:45:26,993 --> 00:45:28,473
I hope to move to Persia

620
00:45:28,533 --> 00:45:29,913
after the war.

621
00:45:30,083 --> 00:45:32,253
Do you believe Europe under The Reich

622
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:34,403
won't suit you after our victory?

623
00:45:35,123 --> 00:45:36,413
No, not at all.

624
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:38,623
My brother lives in Teheran.

625
00:45:40,873 --> 00:45:42,493
I've read your file, Koch.

626
00:45:44,333 --> 00:45:46,033
There isn't a single word there

627
00:45:46,073 --> 00:45:48,093
about your brother in Teheran.

628
00:45:51,783 --> 00:45:52,673
That's right.

629
00:45:52,873 --> 00:45:55,413
I only learned of it about a year ago.

630
00:45:55,833 --> 00:45:59,353
He lived in Greece up until 1939.

631
00:46:02,913 --> 00:46:05,293
Too many coincidences, don't you think?

632
00:46:06,703 --> 00:46:07,733
We come to power

633
00:46:07,773 --> 00:46:10,033
and your brother moves to Greece.

634
00:46:10,673 --> 00:46:12,103
War begins,

635
00:46:12,173 --> 00:46:13,933
and he drifts off to Teheran.

636
00:46:14,623 --> 00:46:16,873
Not much of a patriot.

637
00:46:17,873 --> 00:46:19,953
And now you here with this Moslem.

638
00:46:20,533 --> 00:46:22,133
I assure you, Herr Standartenfuhrer,

639
00:46:22,193 --> 00:46:23,823
I'm not doing anything wrong.

640
00:46:24,243 --> 00:46:26,083
I'm just studying the language.

641
00:46:34,093 --> 00:46:35,583
Let's change the subject.

642
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:39,183
This weekend, I've organized

643
00:46:39,233 --> 00:46:41,073
a nature outing for the troop.

644
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:42,813
A picnic.

645
00:46:44,373 --> 00:46:46,783
Prepare food and drink for thirty people.

646
00:46:47,283 --> 00:46:48,783
But it has to be the finest.

647
00:46:48,993 --> 00:46:50,623
Make sure it's the best we can provide.

648
00:46:50,703 --> 00:46:53,653
Nothing French. Something from the homeland.

649
00:46:54,283 --> 00:46:55,283
Understand?

650
00:46:56,663 --> 00:46:58,783
Will do, Herr Standartenfuhrer.

651
00:47:03,333 --> 00:47:05,163
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil Hitler!

652
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:13,413
Do you know why they called this dish "Eisbein"?

653
00:47:18,033 --> 00:47:20,533
Long ago, they used shin bones of pigs

654
00:47:20,703 --> 00:47:23,123
for making gliders of skates.

655
00:47:26,993 --> 00:47:29,473
I think we've learned enough

656
00:47:29,553 --> 00:47:31,493
food words.

657
00:47:33,623 --> 00:47:35,623
Let's change the subject.

658
00:47:40,033 --> 00:47:42,873
How do you say 'love' in Farsi?

659
00:47:45,033 --> 00:47:46,393
"Onaj".

660
00:47:47,873 --> 00:47:49,243
"Onaj"?

661
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:54,413
Then 'I love you' is... "Ilʲ..."

662
00:47:54,873 --> 00:47:56,933
"... onaj au."

663
00:47:59,953 --> 00:48:02,123
And what does a girl say in return?

664
00:48:04,533 --> 00:48:07,493
If she loves him back, she says the same.

665
00:48:07,703 --> 00:48:09,203
"Ilʲ onaj au."

666
00:48:09,243 --> 00:48:11,083
"Ilʲ bar onaj au."

667
00:48:11,703 --> 00:48:14,203
"Ilʲ bar onaj au."

668
00:48:14,413 --> 00:48:17,373
"Ilʲ... bar..."

669
00:48:17,533 --> 00:48:19,273
It means 'also'.

670
00:48:26,123 --> 00:48:28,153
Are you in love with someone, Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer?

671
00:48:28,873 --> 00:48:30,283
No. Not yet.

672
00:48:31,163 --> 00:48:32,583
But...

673
00:48:34,123 --> 00:48:36,453
maybe, someday...

674
00:48:38,913 --> 00:48:42,243
Why do you ask? Is that so hard to imagine?

675
00:48:48,533 --> 00:48:50,993
Do you think I'm not capable of love?

676
00:48:52,243 --> 00:48:53,373
No.

677
00:48:54,993 --> 00:48:57,073
We're all capable of it.

678
00:49:06,993 --> 00:49:11,623
In the grass there grows a tiny flower...

679
00:49:12,203 --> 00:49:13,833
It is called...

680
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,373
Erika.

681
00:49:16,783 --> 00:49:21,083
Hundreds of thousands pretty bees...

682
00:49:21,873 --> 00:49:25,913
buzz around her – Erika.

683
00:49:26,453 --> 00:49:30,493
Just because there's sweetness in her heart.

684
00:49:30,913 --> 00:49:32,673
An enchanting scent comes

685
00:49:32,813 --> 00:49:34,693
from her flowered dress.

686
00:49:35,333 --> 00:49:39,703
In the grass grows a tiny flower...

687
00:49:40,453 --> 00:49:41,743
It is called...

688
00:49:42,663 --> 00:49:44,873
Erika.

689
00:49:45,413 --> 00:49:46,833
Bravo!

690
00:49:47,913 --> 00:49:49,733
Comrades, ladies and gentlemen,

691
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:51,083
you sang so beautifully.

692
00:49:51,283 --> 00:49:52,873
It touched my heart.

693
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:55,493
I suggest we have some refreshments.

694
00:49:56,163 --> 00:49:57,813
Hauptsturmfuhrer Koch has prepared

695
00:49:57,893 --> 00:49:59,613
a small menu for us.

696
00:50:00,203 --> 00:50:03,163
Tomato soup with roasted butter-croutons.

697
00:50:09,663 --> 00:50:10,913
Soup!

698
00:50:12,453 --> 00:50:13,663
Soup!!

699
00:50:13,833 --> 00:50:15,583
I hope you're all as hungry as I am!

700
00:50:16,373 --> 00:50:17,493
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

701
00:50:17,573 --> 00:50:19,193
we got lucky with the weather!

702
00:50:19,333 --> 00:50:20,663
Koch organized all of it!

703
00:50:20,743 --> 00:50:21,743
Come on!

704
00:50:22,413 --> 00:50:24,413
Nothing but the best, is what I told him.

705
00:50:25,083 --> 00:50:26,613
Get lost!

706
00:50:31,493 --> 00:50:34,033
I didn't know you played the accordion.

707
00:50:34,653 --> 00:50:37,533
There's a lot you don't know about me.

708
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:44,243
Why would you bother, I'm not an officer.

709
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:45,313
Don't be an ass, Max.

710
00:50:47,453 --> 00:50:48,783
Call me a fool if you want,

711
00:50:49,373 --> 00:50:51,453
I kept telling myself that he loves me.

712
00:50:51,703 --> 00:50:54,233
But he used me and then threw me away.

713
00:50:57,163 --> 00:50:58,663
And, are you still in love?

714
00:50:58,993 --> 00:51:01,013
Why do you need to know?

715
00:51:02,533 --> 00:51:04,093
I don't need to.

716
00:51:19,833 --> 00:51:21,283
Cut more bread.

717
00:51:28,243 --> 00:51:32,033
Reza, what is 'tree' in Farsi?

718
00:51:32,493 --> 00:51:33,783
"Radʒ"

719
00:51:38,493 --> 00:51:40,203
What did you say?

720
00:51:42,243 --> 00:51:43,583
"Radʒ"

721
00:51:46,833 --> 00:51:48,163
In Farsi 'tree' is "radʒ".

722
00:51:54,203 --> 00:51:55,833
Oh, you filthy Jew!

723
00:51:56,453 --> 00:51:58,913
I thought you said that "radʒ" means 'bread'.

724
00:52:00,783 --> 00:52:02,743
You lying swine!

725
00:52:02,873 --> 00:52:04,663
It means both 'tree' and 'bread'!

726
00:52:05,583 --> 00:52:06,993
Like 'castle' in German!

727
00:52:07,033 --> 00:52:09,163
Stop lying to me!

728
00:52:13,953 --> 00:52:16,413
I trusted you and you betrayed me!

729
00:52:16,873 --> 00:52:20,313
What for? So you can laugh at me

730
00:52:20,713 --> 00:52:22,413
with the other Jews?

731
00:52:24,083 --> 00:52:26,623
I warned you not to play me for a fool!

732
00:52:34,453 --> 00:52:35,953
He is really worked up!

733
00:52:36,203 --> 00:52:37,993
The Persian must've stolen something.

734
00:52:38,083 --> 00:52:40,493
I'm glad I only took one piece of bread.

735
00:52:40,793 --> 00:52:42,663
Let's leave our man to his protocols!

736
00:53:14,453 --> 00:53:16,033
That sure is hard-earned bread!

737
00:53:16,333 --> 00:53:18,583
So... gentlemen, you wanted bread?

738
00:53:21,533 --> 00:53:22,623
Bread?

739
00:53:30,783 --> 00:53:32,583
Such great company...

740
00:53:33,163 --> 00:53:35,163
is a rare thing nowadays.

741
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:38,623
Believe me, years shall pass

742
00:53:38,783 --> 00:53:40,173
and you'll remember this day

743
00:53:40,233 --> 00:53:42,243
as one of the happiest in your life.

744
00:53:42,583 --> 00:53:43,913
Let's capture this moment

745
00:53:44,053 --> 00:53:45,513
before it gets really dark.

746
00:53:45,703 --> 00:53:46,743
Where is my camera?

747
00:53:46,833 --> 00:53:47,833
Herr Commandant.

748
00:53:47,913 --> 00:53:49,243
I'll do it myself.

749
00:53:49,623 --> 00:53:52,413
Everyone should stand in a semi-circle.

750
00:54:01,663 --> 00:54:03,703
Let's all look happy!

751
00:54:06,453 --> 00:54:07,563
Thank you very much!

752
00:54:07,673 --> 00:54:09,653
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen!

753
00:54:10,783 --> 00:54:13,033
Pity we have to go back to work tomorrow.

754
00:54:13,233 --> 00:54:15,973
It's so lovely in the fresh air, you can forget the smell...

755
00:54:16,123 --> 00:54:17,873
The Persian is of no use to me anymore.

756
00:54:17,953 --> 00:54:19,633
Send him to the quarry tomorrow.

757
00:54:20,703 --> 00:54:22,623
Of course, Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer.

758
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:25,453
I'll request that you be assigned to work supervision.

759
00:54:25,703 --> 00:54:27,413
Make sure his time there is hard.

760
00:54:28,123 --> 00:54:29,783
I can promise you that.

761
00:54:30,993 --> 00:54:32,533
Oh, I can promise you that!

762
00:54:34,623 --> 00:54:35,873
Stand up!

763
00:54:36,493 --> 00:54:38,163
I said, stand up!

764
00:54:38,583 --> 00:54:40,283
Get up! Move it!

765
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:49,913
Let's go!

766
00:54:58,203 --> 00:54:59,333
Here!

767
00:54:59,413 --> 00:55:00,913
Your new workplace.

768
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:06,953
You'll work until I say you're done.

769
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:08,483
Is that understood?

770
00:55:09,163 --> 00:55:10,373
Come on!

771
00:55:14,243 --> 00:55:15,743
Hit harder!

772
00:55:25,373 --> 00:55:26,583
Go on!

773
00:55:30,583 --> 00:55:34,333
No rest for you, is that clear?! Go on!!

774
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:43,283
We'll continue tomorrow.

775
00:55:49,283 --> 00:55:51,413
We'll get a fresh start tomorrow, yes? What do you say?

776
00:55:51,533 --> 00:55:54,163
We'll continue tomorrow! Get going!

777
00:56:10,413 --> 00:56:11,953
What are you doing here?

778
00:56:19,873 --> 00:56:22,163
I thought she was Commandant's for a minute.

779
00:56:22,203 --> 00:56:24,583
That was before. She is mine now.

780
00:56:25,283 --> 00:56:26,493
That's good.

781
00:56:28,373 --> 00:56:29,623
You can have her.

782
00:56:34,203 --> 00:56:36,163
I don't like redheads anyway.

783
00:56:39,373 --> 00:56:40,373
Watch out!

784
00:56:46,663 --> 00:56:49,033
Can you take my shift in the quarry tomorrow?

785
00:56:50,623 --> 00:56:51,993
Why?

786
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:54,513
I'm going to take her to the soldiers' dance.

787
00:56:57,493 --> 00:56:58,733
Yeah, yeah...

788
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:00,653
And break that Persian's back for me!

789
00:57:00,753 --> 00:57:02,213
Finish him!

790
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:11,453
Fill it up!

791
00:57:15,243 --> 00:57:17,163
I said, fill it up!

792
00:57:20,953 --> 00:57:22,373
I can't anymore.

793
00:57:22,873 --> 00:57:24,253
This is work sabotage.

794
00:57:24,363 --> 00:57:26,213
You will be shot for this!

795
00:57:26,413 --> 00:57:27,433
Fill it up!

796
00:57:27,533 --> 00:57:28,623
I can't...

797
00:57:28,913 --> 00:57:30,833
"Ilʲ ma lan."
(I no able.)

798
00:57:32,243 --> 00:57:33,413
"Ilʲ ma lan."
(I no able.)

799
00:57:33,493 --> 00:57:34,913
What did you just say?

800
00:57:38,373 --> 00:57:40,123
Kapo, bring him back to the barracks!

801
00:57:42,623 --> 00:57:44,623
He is of no use here.

802
00:57:58,243 --> 00:57:59,413
I hate that perfume.

803
00:57:59,513 --> 00:58:00,813
Why did you put so much on?

804
00:58:00,913 --> 00:58:02,373
I didn't do it for you.

805
00:58:02,533 --> 00:58:03,743
For who then?

806
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:05,283
Beyer.

807
00:58:05,873 --> 00:58:06,783
Max?

808
00:58:08,123 --> 00:58:10,283
He was so persistent, I finally gave in.

809
00:58:10,533 --> 00:58:12,083
But I thought you said he liked...

810
00:58:12,203 --> 00:58:13,953
He must've changed his mind.

811
00:58:14,953 --> 00:58:16,353
Won't you wait for me?

812
00:58:17,033 --> 00:58:19,033
It's too hot in here, my makeup is running.

813
00:58:21,123 --> 00:58:22,293
But I always wait for you...

814
00:58:22,393 --> 00:58:23,673
See you there, darling!

815
00:58:31,283 --> 00:58:32,993
You look really nice all dressed.

816
00:58:33,123 --> 00:58:34,473
Pardon me?

817
00:58:35,453 --> 00:58:36,703
For you.

818
00:59:04,493 --> 00:59:08,093
"Anta... anta... Ilʲ ora ahan anta."

819
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:10,833
What the hell is he saying?

820
00:59:11,663 --> 00:59:14,373
It must be in his language.

821
00:59:14,453 --> 00:59:16,873
He's been talking like this all night.

822
00:59:19,333 --> 00:59:20,833
"Ilʲ ora ahan."

823
00:59:21,873 --> 00:59:23,283
"Ilʲ ora ahan, anta!"

824
00:59:37,163 --> 00:59:39,413
Well, what am I supposed to hear?

825
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:46,123
"Ilʲ ora ahan, anta."

826
00:59:46,873 --> 00:59:48,663
Do you understand what he's saying?

827
00:59:49,123 --> 00:59:50,203
"Anta..."

828
00:59:52,033 --> 00:59:53,433
"Ilʲ ora ahan..."

829
00:59:54,533 --> 00:59:56,233
"Anta, ilʲ ora ahan..."

830
01:00:01,083 --> 01:00:03,333
He's talking to his mother. He wants to go home.

831
01:00:05,373 --> 01:00:07,413
So he's a Persian after all.

832
01:00:10,163 --> 01:00:12,493
Take him to the hospital. You come with me.

833
01:00:31,743 --> 01:00:33,413
Here are the remaining eight.

834
01:00:33,583 --> 01:00:35,243
A deal is a deal.

835
01:00:44,953 --> 01:00:46,873
Many thanks, Herr Hauptshturmfuhrer.

836
01:01:15,993 --> 01:01:18,333
They really did a number on you, didn't they?

837
01:01:19,783 --> 01:01:22,203
You were screaming some crazy nonsense.

838
01:01:25,783 --> 01:01:26,783
Where am I?

839
01:01:26,873 --> 01:01:28,873
Soldiers' medical ward.

840
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:31,783
Koch ordered you brought here.

841
01:01:34,913 --> 01:01:39,033
What language were you screaming in?

842
01:01:39,533 --> 01:01:40,993
Farsi.

843
01:01:43,663 --> 01:01:46,283
- But not real Farsi.
- What?

844
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,833
I made it up.

845
01:01:52,993 --> 01:01:54,623
What do you mean...

846
01:01:55,123 --> 01:01:56,373
made it up?

847
01:02:03,243 --> 01:02:04,663
I don't know.

848
01:02:06,663 --> 01:02:08,613
Even now... I don't know

849
01:02:08,813 --> 01:02:11,483
what I'm saying even right now.

850
01:02:14,913 --> 01:02:16,933
Oh yes, I told Koch you were crazy –

851
01:02:17,053 --> 01:02:19,693
screaming nonsense like that.

852
01:02:20,623 --> 01:02:22,133
I even offered to inject

853
01:02:22,273 --> 01:02:24,163
some air into your veins...

854
01:02:24,493 --> 01:02:26,583
...to put you out of your misery.

855
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:30,123
But he would have none of it.

856
01:02:31,123 --> 01:02:33,653
He even sent you food a few times.

857
01:02:35,783 --> 01:02:37,533
Strange man.

858
01:02:59,163 --> 01:03:00,873
Test me.

859
01:03:06,123 --> 01:03:08,033
"Radʒ".

860
01:03:13,253 --> 01:03:15,533
I'm sorry, I overreacted.

861
01:03:16,873 --> 01:03:19,433
Let's forget it ever happened.

862
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:22,243
As you wish,

863
01:03:22,913 --> 01:03:24,813
Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer.

864
01:03:51,033 --> 01:03:52,163
Take these.

865
01:03:52,283 --> 01:03:53,993
Yours are worn out.

866
01:03:55,493 --> 01:03:57,053
Did they belong to the prisoners

867
01:03:57,113 --> 01:03:58,863
that were sent East?

868
01:03:59,663 --> 01:04:01,373
No, these are mine.

869
01:04:01,493 --> 01:04:04,133
I've gained some weight here in the camp.

870
01:04:04,783 --> 01:04:06,743
But they should fit you just fine.

871
01:04:09,913 --> 01:04:11,743
Now let's get to work.

872
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:21,623
So, "radʒ" means 'bread'.

873
01:04:26,913 --> 01:04:28,853
and 'tree'.

874
01:04:36,703 --> 01:04:37,833
What if it's Jana?

875
01:04:38,033 --> 01:04:39,783
Do you think he is fucking her now?

876
01:04:40,123 --> 01:04:41,213
If he is...

877
01:04:41,333 --> 01:04:43,033
she's definitely not enjoying it.

878
01:04:43,123 --> 01:04:43,993
Why?

879
01:04:48,283 --> 01:04:49,123
No.

880
01:04:49,533 --> 01:04:50,833
The Commandant's...?

881
01:04:51,033 --> 01:04:52,333
Are you kidding?!

882
01:04:53,333 --> 01:04:54,553
Oh that poor girl!

883
01:04:54,633 --> 01:04:55,623
And you too!

884
01:04:55,783 --> 01:04:56,713
Max!

885
01:04:57,833 --> 01:04:59,243
Then, I just want to say...

886
01:04:59,333 --> 01:05:00,623
that I promise

887
01:05:01,243 --> 01:05:02,953
I will always do better,

888
01:05:03,493 --> 01:05:05,493
be a bigger man

889
01:05:06,123 --> 01:05:08,953
and stand firm, when the need arises.

890
01:05:18,123 --> 01:05:19,373
Come in!

891
01:05:23,703 --> 01:05:24,873
Come in!!

892
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:28,623
Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer,

893
01:05:28,693 --> 01:05:29,953
I'm here to make a report.

894
01:05:30,123 --> 01:05:31,393
Can this wait until tomorrow,

895
01:05:31,433 --> 01:05:32,573
when I'm on duty?

896
01:05:32,663 --> 01:05:34,373
Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer, it's about Herr Standartenfuhrer...

897
01:05:34,413 --> 01:05:35,743
Close the door!

898
01:05:43,283 --> 01:05:45,233
Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer, it's a personal matter

899
01:05:45,353 --> 01:05:46,453
about Herr Standartenfuhrer,

900
01:05:46,493 --> 01:05:48,193
and as such, could not be reported

901
01:05:48,253 --> 01:05:49,493
to the duty officer.

902
01:05:49,703 --> 01:05:50,993
Report then.

903
01:05:51,373 --> 01:05:53,413
Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer, I'm here to report

904
01:05:53,493 --> 01:05:54,703
personal information

905
01:05:54,783 --> 01:05:57,053
which was inappropriately shared

906
01:05:57,153 --> 01:05:58,633
by an officer on duty.

907
01:05:59,123 --> 01:06:00,623
Which officer?

908
01:06:01,373 --> 01:06:02,833
Helferin Elsa Strumpf shared

909
01:06:02,893 --> 01:06:05,203
unethical information about the Commandant

910
01:06:05,243 --> 01:06:07,243
with Rottenfuhrer Beyer.

911
01:06:07,663 --> 01:06:09,373
She also happens to be his lover.

912
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:11,493
What did she say?

913
01:06:13,913 --> 01:06:15,033
I can't repeat it.

914
01:06:15,163 --> 01:06:17,123
Say it now, that's an order!

915
01:06:17,713 --> 01:06:18,993
I don't feel comfortable...

916
01:06:19,073 --> 01:06:21,393
Well, what the hell are you reporting then?!

917
01:06:23,993 --> 01:06:25,333
For God's sake! Report now

918
01:06:25,393 --> 01:06:27,163
and stop playing a virgin with me.

919
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:28,913
Just whisper it into my ear.

920
01:06:46,743 --> 01:06:49,453
What a vindictive little bitch you are,

921
01:06:49,533 --> 01:06:51,113
Helferin Krause.

922
01:06:57,953 --> 01:06:59,533
Thank you for performing your duty.

923
01:06:59,623 --> 01:07:00,623
Dismissed.

924
01:07:02,163 --> 01:07:03,453
Heil Hitler!

925
01:07:12,583 --> 01:07:14,583
As you are well aware, Herr Standartenfuhrer,

926
01:07:15,283 --> 01:07:17,313
there is a total prisoner transport

927
01:07:17,373 --> 01:07:19,153
scheduled for tomorrow.

928
01:07:19,533 --> 01:07:21,413
Of course I am aware of it.

929
01:07:22,833 --> 01:07:24,783
I gave the orders myself.

930
01:07:24,953 --> 01:07:27,243
Of course, Herr Standartenfuhrer.

931
01:07:28,083 --> 01:07:30,953
I'd like your permission to keep the Persian.

932
01:07:31,833 --> 01:07:33,993
He is indispensable to me.

933
01:07:36,163 --> 01:07:38,793
It's a delicate issue to show a preference

934
01:07:38,853 --> 01:07:40,783
for a particular prisoner.

935
01:07:40,913 --> 01:07:41,873
I know,

936
01:07:41,983 --> 01:07:44,513
that's why I came to you with my request.

937
01:07:45,953 --> 01:07:47,533
There is a problem.

938
01:07:47,913 --> 01:07:50,493
There is a report about you and your Persian.

939
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:56,243
It's a good thing only I read it.

940
01:07:56,583 --> 01:07:59,703
The next one might fall into wrong hands.

941
01:08:01,493 --> 01:08:03,993
And so... to hell with him –

942
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:06,853
and your good reputation will remain intact.

943
01:08:08,163 --> 01:08:10,293
Is it possible to find out what's in the report?

944
01:08:13,993 --> 01:08:15,413
As you wish...

945
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:18,783
It says that you're harboring a Jew,

946
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:21,123
who pretends to be Persian.

947
01:08:21,453 --> 01:08:25,033
That the Jew is likely your lover and boy-toy.

948
01:08:25,533 --> 01:08:27,173
And that you removed a female guard

949
01:08:27,253 --> 01:08:28,993
from important bookkeeping duties

950
01:08:29,073 --> 01:08:31,283
and gave it to the parasite.

951
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:33,703
- Shall I go on?
- No, thank you.

952
01:08:35,163 --> 01:08:36,573
That's enough.

953
01:08:36,783 --> 01:08:41,533
All of this has no relation to the truth.

954
01:08:42,203 --> 01:08:43,953
Except the bookkeeping matter.

955
01:08:44,163 --> 01:08:46,373
I will reinstate the Helferin,

956
01:08:46,743 --> 01:08:49,873
whom I'm sure is behind the report,

957
01:08:50,283 --> 01:08:52,873
to resume her substandard work.

958
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:58,453
Well, since we are on the topic

959
01:08:58,513 --> 01:09:00,413
of unsubstantiated gossip,

960
01:09:01,033 --> 01:09:02,493
I can tell you a rumor

961
01:09:02,553 --> 01:09:04,633
which relates directly to you.

962
01:09:08,703 --> 01:09:10,203
I'm all ears.

963
01:09:12,953 --> 01:09:14,133
It's...

964
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:16,413
...nothing big.

965
01:09:17,623 --> 01:09:19,873
It's really a very small matter.

966
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:28,273
There is a rumor going around that...

967
01:09:31,453 --> 01:09:33,453
that you have a very small penis.

968
01:09:35,743 --> 01:09:37,373
Very small. Tiny.

969
01:09:37,783 --> 01:09:40,083
Almost... invisible.

970
01:09:40,663 --> 01:09:43,493
I assume that this rumor is baseless.

971
01:09:44,783 --> 01:09:47,493
And you are in fact, quite amply endowed.

972
01:09:47,993 --> 01:09:50,293
Nonetheless, I just wanted to enlighten you.

973
01:09:54,913 --> 01:09:57,013
Thank you for your understanding,

974
01:09:57,113 --> 01:09:58,693
Herr Standartenfuhrer.

975
01:10:12,783 --> 01:10:15,033
How many words have you learned so far?

976
01:10:17,453 --> 01:10:20,703
About... 1500 words.

977
01:10:23,873 --> 01:10:24,873
Let's talk then.

978
01:10:27,953 --> 01:10:29,413
Who are you?

979
01:10:34,953 --> 01:10:36,373
"Ilʲ Klaus Koch."
(I Klaus Koch.)

980
01:10:36,743 --> 01:10:37,913
Good.

981
01:10:39,373 --> 01:10:40,493
Tell me more...

982
01:10:43,083 --> 01:10:44,493
Where were you born?

983
01:10:44,623 --> 01:10:46,533
Reza, I can't.

984
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:49,163
I memorized the words, but...

985
01:10:49,873 --> 01:10:51,053
Try it.

986
01:10:54,493 --> 01:10:56,663
You think I haven't tried?

987
01:10:58,873 --> 01:11:01,993
"Ori lʲen rav au li?"
(How many years your age?)

988
01:11:03,913 --> 01:11:05,413
I don't know numbers yet.

989
01:11:05,913 --> 01:11:07,123
Right.

990
01:11:07,743 --> 01:11:09,333
We'll learn them later.

991
01:11:11,373 --> 01:11:15,283
"Ælʲ ʃur av au... anta?"
(What name is your... mother?)

992
01:11:16,583 --> 01:11:17,833
Helena, but...

993
01:11:20,413 --> 01:11:22,493
I don't remember her.

994
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:24,613
She died when I was three.

995
01:11:27,623 --> 01:11:30,153
"Ilʲ ma ʃelʲ Alʲman."
(I no understand German.)

996
01:11:31,413 --> 01:11:33,203
"Ælʲ dʲe isi kalʲavi?"
(What with she happened?)

997
01:11:33,283 --> 01:11:36,203
"Isi ʒer ax."
(She have death. )

998
01:11:38,203 --> 01:11:40,663
"Ilʲ ma selʲ isi."
(I no remember she.)

999
01:11:45,783 --> 01:11:47,913
"Au ʃer gælʲ."
(You do good.)

1000
01:11:52,583 --> 01:11:55,873
"Rav ilʲ bawbaw mar..."
(My father disabled...)

1001
01:11:57,033 --> 01:11:59,163
"zeki jah..."
(legs and...)

1002
01:11:59,873 --> 01:12:01,743
"mad" - "mad"
(back) - (back)

1003
01:12:05,833 --> 01:12:08,453
"Ni ma ʒer gus."
(We no have money.)

1004
01:12:08,993 --> 01:12:10,913
"Ni alʲf..."
(We sell...)

1005
01:12:12,163 --> 01:12:14,163
How do you say "hot water"?

1006
01:12:14,783 --> 01:12:15,593
"Lʲest kan."
(Water hot.)

1007
01:12:15,673 --> 01:12:19,163
"Lʲest kan. Ni alʲf lʲest kan."
(Water hot. We sell water hot.)

1008
01:12:23,493 --> 01:12:27,283
"Vi ʒeravi gus lʲeri?"
(You have much money?)

1009
01:12:28,833 --> 01:12:30,163
"Ma."
(No.)

1010
01:12:32,713 --> 01:12:36,593
"Ni ʒer ril rav ɔnor."
(We have little for food.)

1011
01:12:37,533 --> 01:12:40,283
"Felʲ dri... jah..."
(Only cabbage and...)

1012
01:12:40,373 --> 01:12:42,373
"jah him."
(and potato.)

1013
01:12:42,663 --> 01:12:44,453
"Bet mat."
(This rarely.)

1014
01:12:48,913 --> 01:12:52,413
"Haraj au oskavi nar?"
(Of it you became cook?)

1015
01:12:52,783 --> 01:12:54,083
"Oj."
(Yes.)

1016
01:12:56,993 --> 01:13:01,833
"Has rem, ilʲ tar rav ɔnor lʲeri."
(When young, I dream of food much.)

1017
01:13:15,493 --> 01:13:17,533
Tomorrow, I'm sending you to work on a farm,

1018
01:13:17,913 --> 01:13:20,033
while we ship the rest of them.

1019
01:13:22,663 --> 01:13:24,113
Finished!

1020
01:13:25,533 --> 01:13:27,333
You don't need me in the kitchen?

1021
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:29,033
It's just for a couple of days,

1022
01:13:29,073 --> 01:13:30,313
then you'll be back.

1023
01:13:30,413 --> 01:13:31,743
Will they all be killed?

1024
01:13:31,873 --> 01:13:33,083
They're being relocated to Poland.

1025
01:13:33,203 --> 01:13:35,233
- Where they will all be killed...
- Leave it!

1026
01:13:35,913 --> 01:13:37,283
I know nothing.

1027
01:13:38,583 --> 01:13:40,373
I'm just a cook.

1028
01:13:48,873 --> 01:13:51,133
You'll be picked up in the morning. Now go!

1029
01:14:10,693 --> 01:14:12,213
I heard they are shipping all Jews

1030
01:14:12,273 --> 01:14:13,323
to Madagascar.

1031
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:14,603
They're relocating us

1032
01:14:14,753 --> 01:14:16,113
to a different labor camp.

1033
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:20,493
You're both wrong. This is the end of us all!

1034
01:14:21,243 --> 01:14:23,993
I heard rumors that Poland is death.

1035
01:14:24,453 --> 01:14:25,953
We're French – they only kill Jews

1036
01:14:26,033 --> 01:14:27,163
from Poland or Russia.

1037
01:14:27,203 --> 01:14:29,453
Could you all shut up?!

1038
01:14:30,583 --> 01:14:32,663
Some of us are trying to sleep!

1039
01:14:37,783 --> 01:14:40,033
A Jew is a Jew. No matter where he's from.

1040
01:14:40,123 --> 01:14:41,633
Germans need a labor force.

1041
01:14:41,713 --> 01:14:43,113
Jew labor is free.

1042
01:14:43,193 --> 01:14:44,733
There is no profit in killing us.

1043
01:14:44,953 --> 01:14:46,573
You're all naive as children –

1044
01:14:46,633 --> 01:14:47,913
these transit camps are merely

1045
01:14:47,973 --> 01:14:49,393
the gates to hell.

1046
01:14:50,743 --> 01:14:52,373
163

1047
01:14:52,743 --> 01:14:54,123
One six three.

1048
01:14:54,663 --> 01:14:56,123
518

1049
01:14:56,553 --> 01:14:58,163
Five one eight!

1050
01:14:58,663 --> 01:15:00,333
175

1051
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:03,633
175?!!

1052
01:15:03,703 --> 01:15:05,433
- One seven five!
- Too late!

1053
01:15:43,393 --> 01:15:45,593
Get the hell in there!

1054
01:15:55,033 --> 01:15:56,413
Shut up, already!

1055
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:19,213
Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer.

1056
01:16:38,083 --> 01:16:40,033
The register is almost finished.

1057
01:16:40,493 --> 01:16:41,583
Almost?

1058
01:16:41,783 --> 01:16:43,533
We managed to finish loading the whole camp,

1059
01:16:43,633 --> 01:16:45,553
and you can't finish crossing out their names?!

1060
01:16:46,623 --> 01:16:48,413
Get out, I'll do it myself.

1061
01:17:18,783 --> 01:17:20,583
That useless bitch!

1062
01:17:37,873 --> 01:17:38,853
Heil Hitler!

1063
01:17:40,623 --> 01:17:41,873
Heil Hitler!

1064
01:17:56,493 --> 01:17:59,703
I see everything is in exceptional order.

1065
01:18:00,453 --> 01:18:01,743
Thank you, Herr Standartenfuhrer.

1066
01:18:01,833 --> 01:18:04,743
Good. I'm here for another reason.

1067
01:18:05,453 --> 01:18:07,433
Which one of you requested a transfer?

1068
01:18:07,583 --> 01:18:09,933
I did! I asked to be transfered to another camp,

1069
01:18:09,973 --> 01:18:11,553
Herr Standartenfuhrer.

1070
01:18:12,283 --> 01:18:15,293
You, Helferin Krause? Are you sure?

1071
01:18:16,533 --> 01:18:18,333
Yes, Herr Standartenfuhrer.

1072
01:18:18,703 --> 01:18:19,533
That's odd.

1073
01:18:22,413 --> 01:18:23,813
Those bureaucrats must have

1074
01:18:23,873 --> 01:18:25,413
messed things up as usual.

1075
01:18:25,973 --> 01:18:27,483
It seems instead of you, they've made

1076
01:18:27,533 --> 01:18:29,533
a transfer allocation for your friend here.

1077
01:18:29,833 --> 01:18:30,833
Congratulations!

1078
01:18:30,953 --> 01:18:33,373
You're on the next train to the front.

1079
01:18:38,743 --> 01:18:41,273
Aren't you happy to serve the Reich,

1080
01:18:41,353 --> 01:18:42,753
Miss Strumpf?

1081
01:18:44,203 --> 01:18:45,293
Yes.

1082
01:18:45,493 --> 01:18:47,413
I am, Herr Standartenfuhrer!

1083
01:18:48,993 --> 01:18:50,583
Excellent!

1084
01:18:51,213 --> 01:18:53,083
You will leave to the Eastern Front immediately.

1085
01:18:53,193 --> 01:18:55,783
Where I hope you will find plenty

1086
01:18:56,053 --> 01:18:58,493
of what you claimed to lack here.

1087
01:19:24,663 --> 01:19:27,493
You have seven lives like a cat, Persian.

1088
01:19:29,873 --> 01:19:32,473
A little Persian cat.

1089
01:19:35,163 --> 01:19:36,633
You know what?

1090
01:19:37,453 --> 01:19:38,993
I have a strong will.

1091
01:19:39,333 --> 01:19:41,163
And I'm determined to see you die.

1092
01:19:44,533 --> 01:19:45,493
Why don't we do it right now?

1093
01:19:46,123 --> 01:19:46,993
Here.

1094
01:19:49,333 --> 01:19:50,493
Ready?

1095
01:21:06,123 --> 01:21:07,583
Aviva –

1096
01:21:08,123 --> 01:21:09,833

'arm'

1107
01:22:45,083 --> 01:22:47,243
Your name? - Domenico.

1108

01:23:15,413 --> 01:23:16,833
'patience'

1118
01:23:30,783 --> 01:23:32,283
"ærtɔ"

1119
01:23:34,413 --> 01:23:35,583
What?

1120
01:23:37,123 --> 01:23:38,163
Hunger.

1121
01:23:39,953 --> 01:23:41,413
"ærtɔ" means 'hunger'.

1122
01:23:41,493 --> 01:23:42,743
"ærtɔ"

1123
01:23:48,783 --> 01:23:49,913
"anko" –

1124
01:23:51,743 --> 01:23:52,913
'patience'.

1125
01:23:54,953 --> 01:23:56,083
"anko"

1126
01:23:58,333 --> 01:23:59,413
"iko" –

1127
01:24:00,533 --> 01:24:01,623
'understanding'.

1128
01:24:03,453 --> 01:24:04,583
"iko"

1129
01:24:08,413 --> 01:24:09,453
"bramo" –

1130
01:24:10,203 --> 01:24:11,283
'hope'.

1131
01:24:12,743 --> 01:24:13,833
"bramo"

1132
01:24:18,033 --> 01:24:19,123
"ʒelɔ" –

1133
01:24:20,663 --> 01:24:21,783
'work'.

1134
01:24:25,083 --> 01:24:27,623
What a wonderful language!

1135
01:24:29,583 --> 01:24:31,083
"ʒelɔ"

1136
01:24:38,413 --> 01:24:40,193
Don't worry! Stay strong

1137
01:24:40,313 --> 01:24:42,193
and everything will be fine.

1138
01:24:52,283 --> 01:24:53,283
Good evening.

1139
01:24:56,333 --> 01:24:57,373
My name is Marco.

1140
01:24:57,453 --> 01:24:58,833
This is my brother, Jacob.

1141
01:24:58,933 --> 01:25:00,163
He is mute.

1142
01:25:02,493 --> 01:25:03,993
I am Reza.

1143
01:25:04,623 --> 01:25:05,993
I don't speak Italian.

1144
01:25:08,163 --> 01:25:09,243
Aren't you a Jew?

1145
01:25:09,993 --> 01:25:11,453
Persian.

1146
01:25:15,283 --> 01:25:16,673
Why are you coming back so late?

1147
01:25:17,663 --> 01:25:18,953
I work in the kitchen.

1148
01:25:20,993 --> 01:25:22,543
And I thought only us Jews

1149
01:25:22,613 --> 01:25:23,783
knew how to get by.

1150
01:25:23,953 --> 01:25:26,123
But, apparently, Persians do too!

1151
01:25:31,783 --> 01:25:33,993
The Italians that work in the kitchen –

1152
01:25:34,493 --> 01:25:36,913
they say you see an officer after work.

1153
01:25:37,583 --> 01:25:38,453
Why?

1154
01:25:41,123 --> 01:25:42,873
I teach him Persian.

1155
01:26:13,493 --> 01:26:15,493
Hey you! Get up!

1156
01:26:15,953 --> 01:26:16,783
Get up!!

1157
01:26:17,413 --> 01:26:18,743
Get... up!!

1158
01:26:20,953 --> 01:26:22,083
Stand up!

1159
01:26:22,743 --> 01:26:23,743
Leave him alone!

1160
01:26:23,913 --> 01:26:24,913
He's my brother!

1161
01:26:24,993 --> 01:26:26,493
Stand up! You deadbeats, stand up!

1162
01:26:26,873 --> 01:26:28,123
Stand up!

1163
01:26:28,783 --> 01:26:31,033
Fakers! Cheaters! Get up!!

1164
01:27:04,743 --> 01:27:06,083
Enter!

1165
01:27:08,373 --> 01:27:10,073
Come in, sit down.

1166
01:27:11,993 --> 01:27:13,993
I've prepared something.

1167
01:27:16,413 --> 01:27:18,783
I would like to recite something.

1168
01:27:20,993 --> 01:27:23,123
- What do you want to recite?
- A poem.

1169
01:27:23,243 --> 01:27:27,583
I... I wrote a poem. In Farsi.

1170
01:27:35,493 --> 01:27:40,873
"Lom gat runleri ah fab,"
(Wind push clouds to east, )

1171
01:27:41,453 --> 01:27:50,243
"ah dan ufi... ʧen rav glo."
(to place soul yearns for peace.)

1172
01:27:51,373 --> 01:27:58,163
"Ilʲ vit ranaro talʲ sab,"
(I know I will be happy there, )

1173
01:27:59,283 --> 01:28:04,873
"æni runljeri san flo."
(where clouds now go.)

1174
01:28:07,453 --> 01:28:09,433
What do you say?

1175
01:28:11,913 --> 01:28:15,583
I like it very much, Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer.

1176
01:28:17,953 --> 01:28:20,993
Don't call me that. Call me Klaus.

1177
01:28:21,873 --> 01:28:23,493
I don't know if I can.

1178
01:28:23,533 --> 01:28:25,283
Try it. Come on!

1179
01:28:26,583 --> 01:28:28,033
Eat this!

1180
01:28:38,163 --> 01:28:41,453
Can I take this... to the barrack with me,

1181
01:28:43,533 --> 01:28:44,783
Klaus?

1182
01:28:46,373 --> 01:28:47,623
What happened?

1183
01:28:48,123 --> 01:28:49,243
Nothing.

1184
01:28:49,833 --> 01:28:51,243
Everything is fine.

1185
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:53,703
We both know it isn't.

1186
01:28:54,663 --> 01:28:55,873
Who is it for?

1187
01:28:56,533 --> 01:28:57,743
Don't ask.

1188
01:28:58,123 --> 01:28:59,913
You just have to trust me.

1189
01:29:09,453 --> 01:29:11,783
I'll give you some canned meat and bread.

1190
01:29:11,833 --> 01:29:13,413
And I will walk you to the barrack.

1191
01:30:14,833 --> 01:30:16,163
Thank you.

1192
01:30:16,993 --> 01:30:18,663
You saved his life.

1193
01:30:22,243 --> 01:30:24,353
I'm in your debt now.

1194
01:30:28,703 --> 01:30:30,243
You don't owe me anything.

1195
01:30:34,783 --> 01:30:37,633
It's not that I like you so much...

1196
01:30:37,843 --> 01:30:39,113
It's just...

1197
01:30:39,493 --> 01:30:40,713
I promised my mother

1198
01:30:40,773 --> 01:30:42,943
I would bring my brother back home.

1199
01:30:44,453 --> 01:30:47,703
If you die – my brother dies too.

1200
01:30:55,203 --> 01:30:56,373
Get up!!

1201
01:30:57,623 --> 01:30:58,993
Get up!

1202
01:30:59,123 --> 01:31:01,873
Go!! Get going to work!!

1203
01:31:01,993 --> 01:31:04,083
To work! Quickly!

1204
01:31:04,533 --> 01:31:05,533
Quickly!

1205
01:31:05,663 --> 01:31:06,783
Get up!!

1206
01:31:08,413 --> 01:31:10,783
Go to work! Quickly!

1207
01:31:10,993 --> 01:31:12,333
Get up, Jacob!

1208
01:31:12,783 --> 01:31:16,283
Come on, little brother. Be strong!

1209
01:31:16,953 --> 01:31:18,123
Faster!!

1210
01:31:25,033 --> 01:31:26,623
Bunch of lazy bastards!

1211
01:31:27,093 --> 01:31:28,453
Faster!

1212
01:32:13,783 --> 01:32:14,783
Jew.

1213
01:32:15,083 --> 01:32:16,033
Jew.

1214
01:32:16,873 --> 01:32:17,993
Jew.

1215
01:32:19,243 --> 01:32:20,493
Jew.

1216
01:32:25,623 --> 01:32:26,873
Are you Persian?

1217
01:32:26,993 --> 01:32:28,163
French.

1218
01:32:28,743 --> 01:32:31,953
French? That's what I thought.

1219
01:32:32,873 --> 01:32:33,953
Jew.

1220
01:32:34,533 --> 01:32:35,583
Jew.

1221
01:32:36,083 --> 01:32:37,123
Jew.

1222
01:32:42,663 --> 01:32:44,413
What nationality are you?

1223
01:32:47,663 --> 01:32:49,163
Who are you?

1224
01:32:49,453 --> 01:32:51,373
I'm talking to you!!

1225
01:32:52,123 --> 01:32:53,283
You hear me?!

1226
01:32:53,703 --> 01:32:55,163
He's an Englishman.

1227
01:32:56,453 --> 01:32:57,953
He doesn't speak a word in German.

1228
01:32:59,493 --> 01:33:00,783
An Englishman?

1229
01:33:02,953 --> 01:33:04,493
Look at his uniform –

1230
01:33:05,933 --> 01:33:07,663
British Air Force.

1231
01:33:09,533 --> 01:33:11,163
English plane – Englishman.

1232
01:33:11,583 --> 01:33:13,913
I thought the British were a fair race,

1233
01:33:14,033 --> 01:33:16,653
blonde or at least red-haired.

1234
01:33:17,913 --> 01:33:20,113
Ethnically, this one is Persian...

1235
01:33:20,663 --> 01:33:21,663
I believe.

1236
01:33:24,623 --> 01:33:25,913
Are you kidding me?

1237
01:33:26,373 --> 01:33:27,953
The British stick rabble

1238
01:33:28,033 --> 01:33:30,483
from all their colonies into their army.

1239
01:33:30,783 --> 01:33:32,413
Is he a real Persian?

1240
01:33:32,703 --> 01:33:34,783
Like I said – I believe so.

1241
01:33:35,783 --> 01:33:38,083
You are Persian and you say nothing?!

1242
01:33:38,163 --> 01:33:40,123
You're a real Persian?

1243
01:33:41,373 --> 01:33:42,873
I found a Persian!

1244
01:33:43,333 --> 01:33:44,743
You're mine!

1245
01:33:45,413 --> 01:33:47,123
You belong to me!

1246
01:33:49,493 --> 01:33:51,293
You know that soldiers are not allowed

1247
01:33:51,393 --> 01:33:52,403
in the kitchen.

1248
01:33:52,953 --> 01:33:54,243
I know, sweetheart.

1249
01:33:54,373 --> 01:33:55,873
But I found another Persian,

1250
01:33:56,283 --> 01:33:58,633
and I think they'll be happy to meet each other.

1251
01:34:02,083 --> 01:34:03,583
What do you think, Reza?

1252
01:34:04,953 --> 01:34:06,373
Are you coming with me?

1253
01:34:08,163 --> 01:34:09,223
We must wash our hands

1254
01:34:09,273 --> 01:34:10,713
before leaving the kitchen.

1255
01:34:11,083 --> 01:34:12,053
What?

1256
01:34:12,373 --> 01:34:13,623
Wash our hands?

1257
01:34:14,493 --> 01:34:15,993
That is the rule.

1258
01:34:19,953 --> 01:34:22,493
Fine, I understand.

1259
01:34:23,123 --> 01:34:24,533
After you.

1260
01:34:49,743 --> 01:34:52,833
I've waited so long, I can wait all night.

1261
01:34:53,493 --> 01:34:55,243
Go ahead. Wash them again.

1262
01:35:09,833 --> 01:35:11,333
The British pilot, is he here?

1263
01:35:11,493 --> 01:35:12,663
Over there.

1264
01:35:19,033 --> 01:35:21,163
You'll have a real family reunion, won't you?

1265
01:35:21,453 --> 01:35:23,553
Let's see how well you understand each other.

1266
01:35:25,873 --> 01:35:27,333
Hey, wake up!

1267
01:35:27,743 --> 01:35:28,703
Wake up!

1268
01:35:36,623 --> 01:35:38,413
How did you do this, huh?

1269
01:35:38,493 --> 01:35:39,873
He was alive twenty minutes ago!

1270
01:35:39,993 --> 01:35:41,333
- Who did this?
- I don't know!

1271
01:35:41,413 --> 01:35:42,493
Who did this?!

1272
01:35:43,033 --> 01:35:44,493
Did you do this?

1273
01:35:45,913 --> 01:35:47,203
You shit rat!

1274
01:35:47,243 --> 01:35:48,413
Tell me who did this!

1275
01:35:49,333 --> 01:35:50,663
Don't lie to me – who did this?!

1276
01:35:50,783 --> 01:35:51,583
I don't know!

1277
01:35:51,703 --> 01:35:52,693
Don't lie to me!!

1278
01:35:57,613 --> 01:35:58,953
I don't know!

1279
01:36:03,493 --> 01:36:04,663
Leave him alone!

1280
01:36:04,783 --> 01:36:06,083
I did it!

1281
01:36:12,743 --> 01:36:13,953
I did it.

1282
01:36:40,033 --> 01:36:41,413
Why are you howling?

1283
01:36:42,033 --> 01:36:44,443
You're howling, because you think it's unfair?

1284
01:36:44,873 --> 01:36:46,913
Do all of you think it's unfair?!

1285
01:36:47,833 --> 01:36:49,953
You are asking yourselves – why us?!

1286
01:36:50,033 --> 01:36:50,833
Why you?!

1287
01:36:50,913 --> 01:36:52,833
Because you are fucking traitors!

1288
01:36:53,203 --> 01:36:54,373
All of you!!

1289
01:36:54,493 --> 01:36:55,493
Everybody!!

1290
01:37:07,993 --> 01:37:10,453
The Allied Air Forces bombed our railway tracks,

1291
01:37:10,703 --> 01:37:11,873
but we must continue

1292
01:37:11,953 --> 01:37:15,613
the transfers of prisoners as planned.

1293
01:37:16,743 --> 01:37:18,033
We will march them

1294
01:37:18,113 --> 01:37:21,193
to the nearest working rail line tomorrow.

1295
01:37:22,033 --> 01:37:24,533
Can't tell, whether it's rain or snow out there.

1296
01:37:24,783 --> 01:37:27,083
Either way, it's shit.

1297
01:37:31,583 --> 01:37:32,413
Damn it!

1298
01:37:34,083 --> 01:37:35,993
Do not doubt the power of the Wehrmacht!

1299
01:37:36,583 --> 01:37:37,663
We are the SS.

1300
01:37:37,743 --> 01:37:40,283
And we will destroy all enemies of the Reich!

1301
01:37:48,413 --> 01:37:52,073
Farewell my lovely dear,

1302
01:37:52,153 --> 01:37:55,573
farewell, farewell, farewell.

1303
01:37:55,873 --> 01:37:59,703
We must, we must all part forever.

1304
01:37:59,833 --> 01:38:03,203
Farewell, farewell, farewell.

1305
01:38:03,533 --> 01:38:11,033
It's about Germany's glory, glory, glory.

1306
01:38:11,163 --> 01:38:14,953
All hail, all hail our victory,

1307
01:38:14,993 --> 01:38:17,953
All hail our victory.

1308
01:38:44,493 --> 01:38:46,123
Nasty weather.

1309
01:38:52,453 --> 01:38:54,953
I heard about what happened.

1310
01:38:55,533 --> 01:38:58,573
I understand why you're so sad.

1311
01:38:59,373 --> 01:39:02,243
I'm sorry about that Persian.

1312
01:39:10,953 --> 01:39:13,203
How great it would have been...

1313
01:39:15,743 --> 01:39:18,163
for us three to talk,

1314
01:39:20,373 --> 01:39:22,333
to practice Farsi.

1315
01:39:25,283 --> 01:39:27,453
He would have been like a brother to you.

1316
01:39:33,663 --> 01:39:36,163
Tomorrow, you'll go the farm again.

1317
01:39:43,083 --> 01:39:46,203
You know, my brother and I had a falling out.

1318
01:39:47,533 --> 01:39:49,703
Ever since I joined The Party,

1319
01:39:51,123 --> 01:39:53,333
he hasn't spoken a word to me.

1320
01:39:54,533 --> 01:39:56,373
Why did you do that?

1321
01:39:57,493 --> 01:39:58,533
What?

1322
01:39:58,703 --> 01:40:00,783
Join the Party.

1323
01:40:04,993 --> 01:40:06,873
I don't really know.

1324
01:40:08,283 --> 01:40:10,583
I was walking down the street

1325
01:40:11,743 --> 01:40:13,993
and they were standing there,

1326
01:40:14,283 --> 01:40:15,783
smoking,

1327
01:40:16,203 --> 01:40:18,283
in their brown shirts,

1328
01:40:19,993 --> 01:40:22,703
laughing and talking so cheerfully.

1329
01:40:28,833 --> 01:40:30,933
So I went and joined them.

1330
01:40:37,283 --> 01:40:38,583
And then?

1331
01:40:44,993 --> 01:40:46,953
That was in '32.

1332
01:40:48,493 --> 01:40:50,493
A year later my brother had troubles,

1333
01:40:50,553 --> 01:40:52,153
and had to escape.

1334
01:40:53,203 --> 01:40:54,243
Where to?

1335
01:40:58,583 --> 01:41:00,163
To Teheran...

1336
01:41:02,453 --> 01:41:04,093
I think.

1337
01:41:05,283 --> 01:41:08,453
Your brother is much smarter than you, Klaus.

1338
01:41:38,493 --> 01:41:40,743
Why are you so angry with me?

1339
01:41:42,623 --> 01:41:44,913
I didn't kill your countryman.

1340
01:41:47,833 --> 01:41:49,583
I'm just tired.

1341
01:41:51,743 --> 01:41:53,033
Tired?

1342
01:41:54,493 --> 01:41:55,783
Of what?

1343
01:41:58,083 --> 01:41:59,703
Of being afraid.

1344
01:42:05,583 --> 01:42:07,013
As long as you work for me,

1345
01:42:07,073 --> 01:42:09,033
you don't need to be afraid.

1346
01:42:15,703 --> 01:42:16,873
You know what?

1347
01:42:17,953 --> 01:42:20,533
I'll bet you 20 cans of meat

1348
01:42:21,163 --> 01:42:23,213
that nothing will happen to you.

1349
01:42:26,743 --> 01:42:29,203
Too bad, if I win, I won't get to eat them,

1350
01:42:29,333 --> 01:42:30,913
since I'll be dead.

1351
01:44:13,703 --> 01:44:15,373
Bloody cold.

1352
01:44:16,583 --> 01:44:18,413
I believe our continued presence here

1353
01:44:18,493 --> 01:44:20,413
is no longer necessary, Obersturmfuhrer Krupp.

1354
01:44:20,623 --> 01:44:21,743
Yes, of course.

1355
01:44:22,953 --> 01:44:25,203
It's all under control here.

1356
01:44:34,243 --> 01:44:35,243
Lunch, then?

1357
01:44:36,783 --> 01:44:37,663
Yes.

1358
01:44:39,533 --> 01:44:40,783
What's for lunch today?

1359
01:44:41,583 --> 01:44:42,873
Baked fish.

1360
01:44:43,033 --> 01:44:44,623
With potato puree and red cabbage.

1361
01:44:47,993 --> 01:44:49,873
I hate fish.

1362
01:44:51,743 --> 01:44:53,333
It's fabulous!

1363
01:44:53,783 --> 01:44:54,873
What is this beauty?

1364
01:44:56,703 --> 01:44:59,163
Sea trout. From the Rhine.

1365
01:45:00,163 --> 01:45:01,663
Mecklenburg, Western Pomerania.

1366
01:45:02,783 --> 01:45:03,833
Gentlemen.

1367
01:45:06,413 --> 01:45:08,873
Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer, I see you decided

1368
01:45:08,933 --> 01:45:10,533
to part with your Persian.

1369
01:45:13,333 --> 01:45:15,123
Why do you say that?

1370
01:45:16,243 --> 01:45:17,593
Because I just saw him

1371
01:45:17,703 --> 01:45:19,363
at the prisoner transport.

1372
01:45:20,663 --> 01:45:21,663
Thank you.

1373
01:45:24,373 --> 01:45:26,573
Have you learned all the words you need?

1374
01:45:29,783 --> 01:45:32,513
You must have made a mistake, Herr Obersturmfuhrer.

1375
01:45:35,743 --> 01:45:37,533
To err is human.

1376
01:45:38,163 --> 01:45:39,663
Maybe you need glasses?

1377
01:45:40,243 --> 01:45:41,663
Well, I'm not blind yet.

1378
01:45:52,623 --> 01:45:53,833
Gentlemen,

1379
01:45:54,623 --> 01:45:55,993
I wish you bon appetit.

1380
01:45:56,203 --> 01:45:58,203
We will certainly have it. Thank you!

1381
01:46:00,493 --> 01:46:02,373
After all, I haven't eaten anything today.

1382
01:46:35,533 --> 01:46:36,493
Reza!

1383
01:46:38,373 --> 01:46:39,953
"Ǽlʲ au ʃer sav?"
(What you do here?)

1384
01:46:40,583 --> 01:46:42,663
"Ad istɔ tefleri ʃer."
(As they all do.)

1385
01:46:48,493 --> 01:46:49,743
Siemens, look back!

1386
01:46:52,413 --> 01:46:53,873
Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer!

1387
01:46:56,623 --> 01:46:58,123
Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer!

1388
01:46:59,333 --> 01:47:00,623
Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer!

1389
01:47:02,413 --> 01:47:03,653
Excuse me!

1390
01:47:04,493 --> 01:47:05,783
This man is coming with me!

1391
01:47:05,873 --> 01:47:07,453
It's impossible. The lists have been closed...

1392
01:47:07,493 --> 01:47:08,283
Damn your fucking lists!

1393
01:47:08,373 --> 01:47:10,583
This man goes with me! That's an order!

1394
01:47:10,743 --> 01:47:12,663
I need an order from the Commandant.

1395
01:47:15,123 --> 01:47:16,273
I'll shoot you right now,

1396
01:47:16,393 --> 01:47:18,363
and then get the order from Commandant.

1397
01:47:19,743 --> 01:47:21,203
As you wish.

1398
01:47:33,873 --> 01:47:35,873
Who left the camp instead of you?

1399
01:47:36,203 --> 01:47:37,633
Another prisoner.

1400
01:47:39,033 --> 01:47:40,833
Is it the same person you brought food to?

1401
01:47:40,953 --> 01:47:42,053
Yes.

1402
01:47:43,583 --> 01:47:44,973
Who is he to you?

1403
01:47:45,493 --> 01:47:46,933
He is no one to me.

1404
01:47:47,123 --> 01:47:49,123
Just a mute boy from Italy.

1405
01:47:50,283 --> 01:47:52,033
A mute boy from Italy!

1406
01:47:52,493 --> 01:47:54,243
And you would sacrifice your life for him?

1407
01:47:54,333 --> 01:47:56,043
For him you would die

1408
01:47:56,513 --> 01:47:58,233
with that nameless horde?

1409
01:48:00,493 --> 01:48:01,593
They're only nameless,

1410
01:48:01,723 --> 01:48:03,273
because you don't know their names.

1411
01:48:04,123 --> 01:48:05,873
But they are no worse than you!

1412
01:48:10,203 --> 01:48:12,293
At least they are not murderers.

1413
01:48:13,743 --> 01:48:15,493
I'm not a murderer.

1414
01:48:17,583 --> 01:48:18,743
No.

1415
01:48:19,703 --> 01:48:21,853
You just make sure the murderers eat well.

1416
01:49:02,743 --> 01:49:04,673
Gentlemen, the entire defensive front

1417
01:49:04,753 --> 01:49:06,243
has been placed on high alert.

1418
01:49:06,283 --> 01:49:08,573
The Americans, with support of their air forces,

1419
01:49:08,673 --> 01:49:10,673
are advancing faster than we expected.

1420
01:49:10,753 --> 01:49:13,083
To be precise, they are already here.

1421
01:49:13,783 --> 01:49:15,033
The High Command in Berlin

1422
01:49:15,133 --> 01:49:16,913
has ordered the camp to be evacuated.

1423
01:49:17,163 --> 01:49:19,743
All work must be stopped immediately.

1424
01:49:20,493 --> 01:49:22,293
All evidence and the remaining prisoners

1425
01:49:22,353 --> 01:49:23,743
must be disposed of.

1426
01:49:24,033 --> 01:49:25,753
You have orders to lock the prisoners

1427
01:49:25,833 --> 01:49:27,073
in the barracks

1428
01:49:27,333 --> 01:49:28,833
and turn off their lights.

1429
01:49:29,033 --> 01:49:30,533
You undestand what I mean?

1430
01:50:07,493 --> 01:50:11,033
Next barrack! Hurry up!

1431
01:50:50,203 --> 01:50:51,493
- Where is he?
- Who?

1432
01:50:51,583 --> 01:50:54,533
Joon! Prisoner Reza Joon!!

1433
01:50:57,973 --> 01:50:59,703
"Liv ilʲ!"
(Follow me!)

1434
01:51:26,873 --> 01:51:27,913
Max!

1435
01:51:28,083 --> 01:51:29,203
Max, let it be!

1436
01:51:29,333 --> 01:51:30,333
Leave it!

1437
01:51:33,493 --> 01:51:34,623
No, no, no!

1438
01:52:12,493 --> 01:52:13,823
Herr Obersturmfuhrer, I need

1439
01:52:13,893 --> 01:52:15,333
to speak with the Commandant.

1440
01:52:15,453 --> 01:52:17,473
Why are you not participating in the liquidation?

1441
01:52:17,583 --> 01:52:19,693
It's important! It's very important!

1442
01:52:19,993 --> 01:52:21,573
The Commandant is busy.

1443
01:52:23,033 --> 01:52:24,493
All right, then I'll wait.

1444
01:52:51,243 --> 01:52:52,923
Herr Standartenfuhrer, I am reporting

1445
01:52:53,033 --> 01:52:54,953
that Hauptsturmfuhrer Koch has left the camp.

1446
01:52:55,083 --> 01:52:56,663
Against your orders.

1447
01:52:59,743 --> 01:53:01,703
And he took one of the prisoners with him!

1448
01:53:14,283 --> 01:53:15,873
Who are you?

1449
01:53:18,993 --> 01:53:21,743
Beyer. Rottenfuhrer Beyer.

1450
01:53:22,373 --> 01:53:24,853
Von Dewitz, it seems Rottenfuhrer Beyer

1451
01:53:24,913 --> 01:53:26,733
has lost his purpose.

1452
01:55:02,243 --> 01:55:03,413
Where are you going?

1453
01:55:08,703 --> 01:55:11,453
Ten kilometers from here is a small airfield.

1454
01:55:11,783 --> 01:55:13,233
There is a plane waiting

1455
01:55:13,293 --> 01:55:14,833
to take me to Istanbul.

1456
01:55:15,373 --> 01:55:17,533
From there I fly to Teheran.

1457
01:55:24,083 --> 01:55:25,953
Then why did you bring me with you?

1458
01:55:28,243 --> 01:55:31,373
Remember our bet for twenty cans of meat?

1459
01:55:32,703 --> 01:55:34,623
I didn't want to lose.

1460
01:55:35,873 --> 01:55:37,893
"Ani gælʲ!"
(Good life!)

1461
01:57:15,243 --> 01:57:18,233
"Ilʲ salʲ au, gælʲ sid!"
(I greet you, good sir!)

1462
01:57:20,873 --> 01:57:23,373
"Vian rav ilʲ gælʲ."
(Document for me good.)

1463
01:57:29,193 --> 01:57:31,123
What language are you speaking?

1464
01:57:32,703 --> 01:57:35,413
Your passport says you're Belgian.

1465
01:57:37,533 --> 01:57:38,653
"Oj."
(Yes.)

1466
01:57:38,793 --> 01:57:41,243
"Ilʲ Marcel Gallant."
(I'm Marcel Gallant.)

1467
01:57:42,243 --> 01:57:44,033
"Rav ilʲ..."
(I have...)

1468
01:57:45,243 --> 01:57:46,613
"... lʲenleri."
(...years.)

1469
01:57:47,333 --> 01:57:48,993
"Au shelʲ?"
(You understand?)

1470
01:57:51,163 --> 01:57:53,083
Khiobi! - Yes?

1471
01:57:53,283 --> 01:57:54,393
I don't understand this man.

1472
01:57:54,593 --> 01:57:55,783
Come and try to talk to him.

1473
01:58:04,783 --> 01:58:06,283
"Oj."
(Yes.)

1474
01:58:08,283 --> 01:58:10,833
"Ilj jom Farsi ben gælj."
(I speak Farsi much good.)

1475
01:58:11,203 --> 01:58:12,853
He is speaking absolute gibberish.

1476
01:58:12,993 --> 01:58:13,993
Very suspicious.

1477
01:58:14,243 --> 01:58:16,123
And he looks like a German.

1478
01:58:16,163 --> 01:58:18,493
We are supposed to detain them for questioning.

1479
01:58:18,833 --> 01:58:22,283
"Ilʲ... Marcel Gallant."
(I... Marcel Gallant.)

1480
01:58:22,693 --> 01:58:25,993
"Ilʲ... flo ah hilʲ."
(I... go to brother.)

1481
01:58:26,203 --> 01:58:31,453
"Ilʲ... Ilʲ flɔ rav gas ɔnordan."
(I... I go to open restaurant.)

1482
01:58:31,623 --> 01:58:33,133
"Au ʃelʲ?"
(You understand?)

1483
01:58:33,663 --> 01:58:35,083
Akhbari! Come! Come!

1484
01:58:35,163 --> 01:58:38,033
"Ah ælj au ma ʃelʲ?!"
(Why you no understand?!)

1485
01:58:40,413 --> 01:58:41,533
Grab him!

1486
01:58:42,373 --> 01:58:43,953
Hold him! Hold him!

1487
01:58:44,163 --> 01:58:45,583
Stand still, you!

1488
01:58:58,913 --> 01:59:01,143
In your estimate, how many prisoners

1489
01:59:01,343 --> 01:59:03,153
have passed through the camp,

1490
01:59:03,453 --> 01:59:05,373
while you were there?

1491
01:59:07,663 --> 01:59:09,283
About...

1492
01:59:12,163 --> 01:59:14,623
twenty five to thirty thousand.

1493
01:59:16,163 --> 01:59:18,333
Do you remember anyone?

1494
01:59:19,413 --> 01:59:22,493
Could you give us a few names?

1495
01:59:24,163 --> 01:59:26,053
All the names are listed in the camp's registers.

1496
01:59:26,133 --> 01:59:28,033
You can check them.

1497
01:59:28,533 --> 01:59:30,283
They carefully recorded everyone

1498
01:59:30,373 --> 01:59:31,773
who entered or went out.

1499
01:59:33,493 --> 01:59:36,873
Unfortunately, there are no registers.

1500
01:59:37,493 --> 01:59:40,033
All the records of your camp

1501
01:59:40,273 --> 01:59:44,153
were burned by the Nazis before liberation.

1502
01:59:48,953 --> 01:59:51,583
Do you remember some of the names?

1503
01:59:54,913 --> 01:59:56,163
Yes.

1504
01:59:59,533 --> 02:00:01,163
I remember.

1505
02:00:04,873 --> 02:00:06,873
I can give you...

1506
02:00:09,373 --> 02:00:11,333
2840 names.

1507
02:00:13,623 --> 02:00:15,243
Of people?

1508
02:00:16,083 --> 02:00:17,333
Yes.

1509
02:00:17,913 --> 02:00:21,663
The first and last names of 2840 people.
