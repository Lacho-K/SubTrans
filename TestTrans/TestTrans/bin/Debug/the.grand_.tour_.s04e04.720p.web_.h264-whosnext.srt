1
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,640
Hello and welcome to the enormous
catapult machine that we built

2
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,120
to keep ourselves amused
during the COVID lockdown.

3
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,000
I've no idea what we're gonna
use it for, but who knows,

4
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,200
maybe something will come to mind
as we set out in this show

5
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,280
to answer an important question:

6
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,760
what is the matter with the French?

7
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,520
Now, I wanna make it plain
at the outset that I like France.

8
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,720
So does Hammond.

9
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,840
May thinks it's only there
so we can drive to Italy more easily.

10
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,880
But we are all in agreement
on one thing.

11
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,960
The French can be a bit weird.

12
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,960
The fact is that we live in
a homogenized world these days.

13
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,000
We all eat the same food

14
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,160
and wear the same clothes

15
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,120
and do the same things.

16
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,240
But not in France.

17
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,920
France is different.

18
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,800
They take most of their medicines anally.

19
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,120
And at work, you're not allowed, by law,

20
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,400
to eat your lunch at your desk.

21
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,200
You must go and do it somewhere properly.

22
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,360
In schools, tomato ketchup is banned,
but until the 1980s,

23
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,640
kids could be served alcohol
with their school dinners.

24
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,920
French bakers are not allowed
to close when they want

25
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,160
because there must always be a supply
of croissant and baguette.

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,840
And French footballers
are unusual as well.

27
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,160
When the seagulls...

28
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,040
follow the trawler,

29
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,320
it's because they think

30
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,080
sardines will be thrown into the sea.

31
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,880
And if you wanna say
"I feel lucky" in French,

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,880
you say "Avoir le cul bordé de nouilles,"

33
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,080
which means
"My bottom is full of noodles."

34
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,880
Surprised there's room with
all the pills up there.

35
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,720
But it's on the road where this oddness
is at its most evident.

36
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,120
French cars have always been weird.

37
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,240
They've always flown
in the face of convention.

38
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,280
And from their pantheon of strangeness,

39
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,960
I've bought this...

40
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,880
A Citroen CX Safari.

41
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,600
It wasn't easy to find one, as most
have been turned into motorhomes,

42
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,240
but it was worth the effort because...

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,360
this is perhaps the most French,

44
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,200
French car of them all.

45
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,800
Take the indicators. You operate them
using this rocker switch here.

46
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,280
But because that's nowhere
near the steering column,

47
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,720
the indicating doesn't self-cancel

48
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,560
after you've made the turn.

49
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,400
And then there's the stereo, which is
mounted vertically between the seats.

50
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,920
And that's fine, but...

51
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,000
If you're enjoying

52
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,320
a cheeky pain au chocolat
as you drive along, and a bit of pastry,

53
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,240
falls off, which it will,

54
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,880
it'll end up in the cassette player,

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,120
where it will

56
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,520
spoil your enjoyment of
the Vanessa Paradis song

57
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,080
you were listening to.

58
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,160
It's as though Citroen's engineers

59
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,440
looked at what everyone else
was doing in the 1970s

60
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,880
and then did something else.

61
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,240
Even the brake pedal's weird because

62
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,520
it's effectively a switch,
the brakes are on,

63
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,760
or they're off. It's just about impossible

64
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,680
to use it properly.

65
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,800
Probably easier when you get to
your destination to just...

66
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,600
Do a George Michael.

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,760
This is what I've chosen.

68
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,920
A Matra Murena.

69
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,080
It's from the '80s. A mid-engine,
two-seater sports car.

70
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,520
Except it's got three seats.

71
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,680
I suppose maybe
if my wife and my mistress

72
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,160
want to go out for a drive
at the same time, I've got that covered.

73
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,120
And it's not a sports car either

74
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,080
because the engine is a tiny 1.6

75
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,240
which produces just 88 horsepower.

76
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,640
It doesn't make any sense.
Matra built the Exocet missile.

77
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,800
That is a fast thing.

78
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,480
This is really not.

79
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,000
Then, there's its name.

80
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,040
Everywhere else in the world
they name cars after

81
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,120
exciting animals, like Jaguar,
Mustang, or exotic winds,

82
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,360
Khamsin, Scirocco.

83
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,480
Matra, no, they chose Murena,

84
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,200
which is a Latin word

85
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,360
meaning "son of a plebeian family
who likes eels."

86
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,760
"Been through
the dictionaries of all the languages

87
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,520
"and we have found the word.

88
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,320
"That is... Nobody will get that,

89
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,360
"that is weirder than any other name
we could give it. We will have it."

90
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,440
Mind you, this car is nothing

91
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
compared to what May has bought.

92
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,880
Bonjour, viewers.

93
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,880
Now, back in 1998,

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,960
Renault told its designers that
they wanted a large, luxury coupé,

95
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,920
you know, something a bit
like a BMW 6 Series.

96
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,440
So, this is what they came up with.

97
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,040
The Avantime.

98
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,480
It's made almost entirely of plastic,

99
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,240
it appears to have been
drawn by an eight-year-old

100
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,040
who liked high-speed trains,

101
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,360
and there are no conventional instruments.

102
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,640
There are just some digital things

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,080
floating around over in the middle there.

104
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,480
Look at all that dashboard
that's there. It's just...

105
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,120
There's just acres of it.

106
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,600
If you wanted to wipe the windscreen
because it had fogged up,

107
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,800
you couldn't do it.

108
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,840
You do get the impression that if
Renault's designers were asked

109
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,880
to design, say, a new dog,

110
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,200
they'd put the head on the other end

111
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,440
and it would have two tails at the front.

112
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,320
They wouldn't be able to do
a conventional dog.

113
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,880
Even the doors on this car are odd.

114
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,160
Mainly because, and I have checked this,

115
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,960
each one weighs more than Kylie Minogue.

116
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,640
That is very heavy.

117
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,880
They claim to be
the heaviest car doors in the world.

118
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,080
Not much of a boast.

119
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,640
And they don't really open.
That is as far as it goes. It's more ajar.

120
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,960
See that. On any sort of a slope,

121
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,960
it can actually be
quite difficult to do it.

122
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,840
Bloody Nora.

123
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,560
Renault has a long history
of automotive oddness.

124
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,640
In the 1950s, for example,

125
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,760
they built this.

126
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,440
It appears to be ordinary,
but look closely

127
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,240
and you'll see
it's all the wrong way round.

128
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,280
Mind you, that's
positively straightforward

129
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,640
compared with this,

130
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,400
the Leyat Hélica.

131
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,160
Who thought, "I know,
we won't drive the wheels,

132
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,160
- "no, everybody's doing that."
- No, no, no, no.

133
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,960
"We'll be propelled along by a propeller?"

134
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,600
If you're driving through
a town center, for example,

135
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,760
what would happen...

136
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,200
If you knock someone over in a car,
it's bad.

137
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,600
But if you knock someone over in that...

138
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,440
No kidneys, liver, offal,

139
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,640
- "No, there's another one..."
- No. They've thought about this

140
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,440
because it's got the propeller,

141
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,120
but they've put bits of wire

142
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,640
so nobody could
put their hand or head through

143
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,400
or anything like that.

144
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,000
It's perfectly...

145
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,360
Has it got a rear seat?

146
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,160
This is a two-seater,
Hammond, unlike your Matra.

147
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,200
Would you get in there

148
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,720
knowing you have absolutely
no control over any of that?

149
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,440
A car with just pedals.

150
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,640
It's not like an airplane
where you've got dual controls.

151
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,880
- It would be mad...
- You just sit there.

152
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,640
I think it's brilliant.

153
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,520
- It is brilliant.
- I mean, look,

154
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,480
I admire it, but...

155
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,600
Did they take it on the Dragon's Den?

156
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,456
"Here is my thought for
a way of traveling."

157
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,280
- But hang on a minute...
- Do you think it works?

158
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,640
Well, I'm sure it does.

159
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,240
Hang on, look, there's...

160
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,160
You don't start it with a key.
There'll be some fiddling.

161
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,240
"Advance" and "Retard." I'll retard it.

162
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,760
Are you gonna prime it?

163
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,496
Compression point is there. Ready?

164
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,840
I don't know what's gonna happen!
How can I be ready?

165
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,720
- Got your feet on the brakes?
- Am I ready?

166
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,640
- Yes.
- The thing's not moving.

167
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,360
- I've got everything. Yeah, go.
- That's the concern. And...

168
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,280
- Oh, wow.
- It didn't go.

169
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,400
Try again.

170
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,640
- Contact?
- Yes.

171
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,000
- Mags on?
- Yes.

172
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,320
- Feet on brakes?
- Yes.

173
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,736
I'm gonna do it.

174
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,640
- It won't start.
- Are you ready?

175
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,720
I really thought that was it.

176
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,280
It's the definition
of anti-climax, isn't it?

177
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,760
This would be a great ambulance.
Or fire engine.

178
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,840
- Brilliant.
- Yeah.

179
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,440
- Throttle set?
- Yes.

180
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,640
- Here we go.
- Yes.

181
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,760
Don't worry,

182
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,880
Monsieur Hélica is on his way
as the emergency vehicle.

183
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,640
"Don't worry. How big is the fire?"

184
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,720
Hang on.

185
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,760
"These pains in your chest,

186
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,240
are they getting worse or better?"

187
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,400
Right, mag on.

188
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,760
I'll tell you what, a stall at the lights
would be a bugger, wouldn't it?

189
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,320
"I'll just... Excuse me..."

190
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,160
'Cause it's a two-man job.

191
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,816
That's a good position.
Here we go.

192
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,120
All right, here we go.

193
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,200
Go!

194
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,400
I think I'll take it for a drive!

195
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,640
- What?
- I'm gonna take it for a drive!

196
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,200
What, you? Run! Run for your life!

197
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,880
When it was unveiled to the world,
600 people put their name down for one.

198
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,200
Six hundred sentient human beings,

199
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,120
who could tie their own shoe laces
and use a lavatory, said,

200
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,920
"Yes, I want one of those."

201
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,440
It's very hard to see why
it didn't catch on.

202
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,880
It is quite loud in here,
surprisingly so.

203
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,360
That could be a factor.

204
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,760
Apparently it's good for
a 106 miles an hour.

205
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,680
I reckon it can do more.

206
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,560
Come on! Come on, come on!

207
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,760
Ha-ha!

208
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,120
I think people are bored

209
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,360
of watching these crashes now,
so let's move on, because...

210
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,240
even when French cars seem to be normal,

211
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,600
you don't have to look too far below
the surface to find that, actually,

212
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,400
they're usually not.

213
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,720
Now, let's take this one,
the Renault 4.

214
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,760
A reasonably straightforward car
for the time, but...

215
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,560
The distance between the wheels
on this side is 94 inches.

216
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,640
Whereas on this side, the distance
between the wheels is 92 inches.

217
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,760
Why?

218
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,640
I've got no idea.

219
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,400
Then there's the Renault 21.

220
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,280
Looks boring, but it isn't,

221
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,240
because in this 1.7-liter model,
the engine is sideways,

222
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,720
whereas in this 2-liter model,

223
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,640
it's lengthwise.

224
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,280
That meant this needed,
longer wings and a different bonnet

225
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,480
and a different subframe...

226
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,440
- Hammond's just crashed, hasn't he?
- Yep.

227
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,480
Anyway, this was an extremely complicated

228
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,200
and expensive solution

229
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,960
to a problem that didn't exist.

230
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,000
And they're still at it today.

231
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,560
This is a brand-new Peugeot 208.

232
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,480
And for some reason,
they've mounted the steering wheel

233
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,160
under the dashboard,

234
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,640
which means it has to be
the size of a shirt button

235
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,920
if you're to get your legs under it.

236
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,680
Why?

237
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,240
Then there's
the Citroen 2CV, which I hate.

238
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,880
This car is the harbinger of everything
that's gone wrong in the world.

239
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,520
Veganism, cycling,

240
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,360
liberal democrats, people who talk
about having "my truth."

241
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,800
There's no such thing.
The truth is that it's awful.

242
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,640
It's not awful.

243
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,680
It's a very practical, sensible car

244
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,120
that stood the test of time for decades.

245
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,360
It survived a war, it liberated
the French peasantry, it's fantastic.

246
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,000
And it's totemic.
That's the most French thing.

247
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,360
If you have a themed restaurant,
or you're doing a film, or painting,

248
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,360
you think,
"How do I make this look French?"

249
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,880
Put a 2CV in it.

250
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,960
It doesn't have wind-down windows.
Look, it's stupid.

251
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,280
Airplanes have these windows.

252
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,000
- It's a...
- What airplane?

253
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,880
- I've never been on one...
- My airplane's got one exactly like that.

254
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,400
This is a fantastic car. Everything in it
is fit for purpose and no more.

255
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,600
I hate the expression "fit for purpose."

256
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,440
- But it is.
- Hello.

257
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,240
- Where's the Hélica?
- It's evidence.

258
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,240
- Let's not get bogged down with that.
- I'm not.

259
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,360
We won't.

260
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,960
Because even I will admit the 2CV
does have very clever suspension.

261
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,440
In fact, it's claimed

262
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,960
that you can drop one from under
a helicopter at a height of 500 feet

263
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,640
and the springs will absorb the impact.

264
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,440
Really?

265
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,920
Well, let's find out.

266
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,720
Okay, and...

267
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,520
Let it go.

268
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,320
There it is.

269
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,200
Yeah, what's happened is,

270
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,720
I've misread the handbook.

271
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,000
It says that "the suspension
is so compliant,

272
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,080
"you can drive across a ploughed field

273
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,560
"with half-a-dozen eggs on the seat
and they won't break."

274
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,360
And how did you misread that?

275
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,160
Well, in my mind, "oeuf" is
the French word for "helicopter."

276
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,760
But...

277
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,760
At this point, I figured
it was best to move on

278
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,800
and examine the relationship
the French have with their cars.

279
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,200
Because it's nothing like the relationship
we have with ours.

280
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,520
Now, if I were in

281
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,040
my car, I'd look at that space and go,

282
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,200
"That's too small,"
and then I'd go find another.

283
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,640
But that's not what
a French person would do.

284
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,000
There's nothing extreme about
this maneuver in France.

285
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,480
This is how you park.

286
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,280
You would see this any day of the week

287
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,280
on any street in Paris.

288
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,640
It's actually for precisely this reason

289
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,920
that the Renault 5 was
the first production car

290
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,160
in the world with deformable bumpers.

291
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:30,000
There's more, too.
I've just bought this dishwasher.

292
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,880
And as you can see, it doesn't
quite fit in the boot of this Peugeot.

293
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,040
I'm British,

294
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,240
so what I'd do is go and buy
a smaller dishwasher,

295
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,480
or I'd borrow a slightly bigger car,

296
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,560
or I'd probably have it delivered.

297
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,000
What the French would do is this,

298
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,320
"Oh, merde."

299
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,560
Has my car stopped moving?

300
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,520
Yes. Am I close to where I wanna be?

301
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,000
Yes.

302
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,560
Well, then I'm parked.

303
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,320
The fact is, that in France, unlike almost

304
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,720
anywhere else, the car is simply

305
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,960
not seen as a status symbol.

306
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,520
If you buy an expensive car,
it's considered bourgeois.

307
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,680
And if you look after it,

308
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,200
that's disgusting.

309
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,920
And the world of Premier League football
backs this up, because what I have here

310
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,480
is a photograph of Willian,
who's Brazilian,

311
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,800
driving his Bentley.

312
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,640
And then there's Ibrahimovic,
who's Swedish, he has a Lamborghini.

313
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,040
Ozil, who's German, has a Porsche.

314
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,800
Marcus Rashford, who's British,
has some kind of trixied-up Range Rover.

315
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,080
And then I've got a photograph here
of Kante, who's French,

316
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,080
driving his MINI.

317
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,320
That he's crashed slightly,
probably while parking.

318
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,320
And you might say,
"What about the President?"

319
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,560
"No way is he going to drive around

320
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,320
"in a small hatchback."

321
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,320
Wrong! Because what I've got here

322
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,800
is a photograph of President Mitterrand

323
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,080
in a Renault 5!

324
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,560
Look at that!

325
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,200
"No, I don't have a chauffeur

326
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,800
"and I don't want a big car.

327
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,320
"It's bourgeois. It is revolting.

328
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,720
"How you say,

329
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,680
"the sick."

330
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,280
This is why no French car maker

331
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,880
has ever made a large off-roader.

332
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,400
The Americans have. The Japanese have.

333
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,080
The Swedes have.

334
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,520
The Germans have. We have.

335
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,080
Even the Italians have.

336
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,960
But not the French.

337
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,080
Their view is that

338
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,560
if you want to go to the top
of that hill over there,

339
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,320
you'd just use your normal family car.

340
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,080
Was talking to a girl
in our office

341
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,320
the other day, who's French.

342
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,800
And she was saying that her parents
have never sold a car.

343
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,440
Buy a Renault 5, run it until it breaks,

344
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,440
scrap it, and then buy a Renault Clio
and run it until it breaks

345
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,320
and scrap it,
and so on and so forth.

346
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,080
If you're not worried about
the second-hand value of your car,

347
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,640
it's so liberating.

348
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,320
In France,
just four percent of people

349
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,920
wash their cars by hand.

350
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,920
Four percent. That's it.

351
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
On a Sunday morning,
what you would not do in France

352
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,920
is get up early
to wash your car on the drive

353
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,400
because your neighbors will hate you.

354
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,920
All those Sunday mornings
I've got up early to wash...

355
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,960
Oh.

356
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,000
I'll just give him
a hand through here.

357
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,880
Lovely.

358
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,560
Merci, monsieur.

359
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,080
I'm looking at Hammond's car.

360
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,480
It's all stoved in from Jeremy's push.

361
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,320
And I'm wincing.
Because I'm British, but...

362
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,160
If you're French,
that's just what a car looks like.

363
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,280
Look, now we are going into the woods.

364
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,760
Can I clear that tree?

365
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,480
Driving along in my car,

366
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,720
going where I need to go.

367
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,000
If I was coming down here in
a 100-thousand-pound Mercedes G-Wagon

368
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,680
I'd be worried about scratching the paint.

369
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,320
But I'm not in a G-Wagon, I'm in my van.

370
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,760
I mean, paint is, to the French,

371
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,280
the wrapper that the car
comes in when it's new.

372
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,440
When I was 17,

373
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,560
on a French exchange trip,

374
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,920
I was staying with a French family.
They had a son my age.

375
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,520
And they bought him
a brand-new Fiat Panda.

376
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,400
I mean, a new car.

377
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,640
And as we sat outside in the sun,
me and them,

378
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,880
his kid brother, five years old,
was throwing stones

379
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,960
at the Panda...

380
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,440
And a chip of paint would come off.

381
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,520
Well, if that had been me

382
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,760
at 17 with a brand-new car,
I would have beaten him to death

383
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,800
with anything that came to hand.

384
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,880
This 17-year-old lad didn't care.

385
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,976
"He's flicking stones at the car."

386
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,120
"It makes a nice noise
as the paint comes off."

387
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,240
What?

388
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,440
Soon, we reached
the halfway point,

389
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,320
where I demonstrated
the Citroen Berlingo's party trick.

390
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,760
It's John!

391
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,080
And then,
after I'd ruined the handbrake...

392
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,600
We joined a sort of rally track.

393
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,520
What we're proving here, I think,
is that a car's ability to get places

394
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,080
and do things is governed entirely

395
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,440
by the driver's willingness
not to care about it.

396
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,520
Please don't be alarmed by those noises.

397
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,440
They don't really mean anything.

398
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,600
This is only what
a typical French person would do

399
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,840
on a rally in Africa

400
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,360
in their mum's Renault 4.

401
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,640
It was, let us not forget,

402
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,800
the French who invented endurance rallies.

403
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,120
Such as the Paris-Peking.

404
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,120
The Paris-Dakar,

405
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,800
and all the other Trans-Africa races.

406
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,640
And, most importantly,

407
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,600
they usually used what was
parked in the drive.

408
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,520
Well, this is bumpy enough
to dislodge your "Gaulois."

409
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,920
Ah!

410
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,600
Merde.

411
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,440
Merci.

412
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,600
Ooh, la, la!

413
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,920
Au revoir, monsieur.

414
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,200
Merci, monsieur!

415
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,600
Well, this is une pièce de gâteau so far.

416
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,360
Oh, that's a...

417
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,560
Monsieur May!

418
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,920
Go on.

419
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,040
Oh, dear. Oh, merde.

420
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,160
Bonjour, monsieur.

421
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,880
As we got closer to the summit,

422
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,240
the going got even tougher.

423
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,200
Now this is an inconvenience.

424
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,480
The windscreen.

425
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,040
Right, this way.

426
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,320
Oh, no, my dishwasher.

427
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,680
Hello.

428
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,160
My family car can go down here
no problem at all.

429
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,240
I don't see... Why do I need a G-Wagon?

430
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,040
Oh.

431
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,440
Merde.

432
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,040
Allez!

433
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,760
Jesus! Fuck! Bloody hellfire!

434
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,920
I've lost the electrically-powered

435
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,520
door mirror on the left-hand side,

436
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,960
but the manual one is still there.

437
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,840
I can't open the window
to adjust my mirror,

438
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,000
but that's okay because it's gone.

439
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,080
Eventually,
with the glorious Welsh hills

440
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,840
bathed in warm afternoon light,

441
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,640
we reached the end of our leisurely drive.

442
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,240
Hammond.

443
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,520
- Wow. Look at the view over there.
- That is... -

444
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,400
- That is just something else.
- Look... It's even got a house

445
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,640
like it's been designed for a train set.

446
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,160
- It's just perfect.
- Absolutely gorgeous.

447
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,080
Oh, hello.

448
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,400
- Bonjour, monsieur.
- I mean, look at that.

449
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,600
Unbelievable, isn't it?

450
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,280
And I tell you what's interesting.

451
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,800
The crew, using all those four-by-fours,
they've made it.

452
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,000
- Yeah.
- But, so have we.

453
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,080
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

454
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,600
Some damage was done.

455
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,720
- Wear and tear.
- It's patina.

456
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,480
It's what happens.
The French might be right.

457
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,920
I think they are.

458
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,040
- I just had a thought.
- What?

459
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,440
Your dishwasher.

460
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,920
Oh, God.
Because Hammond drove into me.

461
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,680
I'm sorry about that.

462
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,360
Where's your boot release?

463
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,280
- Is it in the door?
- Yes.

464
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,560
- Right.
- That's a design flaw.

465
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,640
The next day,
we set off in our own cars

466
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,600
to the next destination.

467
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,320
And on the way, we began to
realize their strangeness

468
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,760
was actually making them more endearing.

469
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,400
Obviously, you don't need
two windscreen wipers, just the one.

470
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,920
And you put the washer in
the wiper blade itself,

471
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
because why would you not do that?

472
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,720
It's different. It's interesting.

473
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,400
Then there's the door mirrors.

474
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,200
So good and so futuristic-looking,

475
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,440
that they were used on
the Aston Martin Vantage,

476
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,240
the Venturi Atlantique,
the Renault Sport Spider,

477
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,000
the Lotus Esprit,

478
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,640
the Jaguar XJ-220 and most TVRs.

479
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,560
On the one hand, this steering wheel
is typically French.

480
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,480
It's weird. It's got one spoke

481
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,920
and it's sort of deep-dish
and a flat bottom.

482
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,080
On the other hand,

483
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,640
it's brilliant. It's the perfect size,
perfect thickness, perfect diameter,

484
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,200
and I can see the dials
'cause there isn't a spoke in the way.

485
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,920
I mean, in many ways,
the weirdness makes them more likeable.

486
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,840
What we see as bloody-mindedness
is actually innovation,

487
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,760
because the French have been
pioneers in motoring.

488
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,160
It wasn't gonna be us.

489
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,200
We were making the Morris Marina.

490
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,760
And don't think it's just
the cars that are odd.

491
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,720
Some of their rules of the road
are quite strange as well.

492
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,720
For example, the French believed,
unlike everyone else,

493
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
that white headlights were wrong

494
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,960
and that they should be yellow.

495
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,880
And if you like driving along to music,

496
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,560
there's a rule which says that
35 percent of pop songs

497
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,360
played on French radio

498
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,400
must be French.

499
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,400
Is that how it's supposed to be

500
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,760
or has un morceau
de pain au chocolat tombéed

501
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,360
into my stereo again?

502
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:30,320
There you go, that was from the country
that gave you Debussy and Messiaen.

503
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,240
One of my favorite French things
is their slovenly attitude

504
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,000
to road signs.
I mean, take this one as an example.

505
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,640
You see this all over France.

506
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,640
What it says is that
the town hall is that way

507
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,880
and everything else, "Toutes Directions,"

508
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,600
everything else is over there.
India, Paris,

509
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,440
Kamchatka Peninsula,

510
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,400
whatever it is you want,
just there, go away.

511
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,600
And then there's the issue of
how to use a roundabout.

512
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,480
Everywhere else in the world,

513
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,080
countries decided that cars
should give way to those already on it.

514
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,120
But not the French.

515
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,600
They decided to do it the other way round.

516
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,520
So, cars on the roundabout would stop
for those wanting to get on.

517
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,360
Like this.

518
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,360
Carry on.

519
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,320
Carry on.

520
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,360
Why would they think
this was the right way to do it?

521
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,120
The point of a roundabout
is to avoid this.

522
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,400
Did you know that half the world's
roundabouts are in France?

523
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,056
Is that really true?

524
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,280
Is it half of all the world's roundabouts

525
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,880
are in a country
that doesn't know what it is?

526
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,440
Yeah. It's a fact.

527
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,360
I mean, it doesn't work.

528
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,800
I'm trying to get out of here.

529
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,040
This is what happens.

530
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,040
I'm doing the roundabout
the French way to see if it works...

531
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,360
I don't care.
Look, you're queued up here.

532
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,840
This is what happens.

533
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,680
Move the vehicle.

534
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,120
That's exactly what's gonna happen.

535
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,200
Hammond's being beaten up by the locals.
I don't blame them.

536
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,760
Move it.

537
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,320
Eventually, we did move it

538
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,800
because it was time to find somewhere for
that most French of things...

539
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,680
Lunch.

540
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,600
Where we discussed another aspect
of French car culture.

541
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,120
Can I just show you
something, Hammond?

542
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,240
This is, as you can see here,

543
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,360
a list of French philosophers,
okay, on Wikipedia.

544
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,080
Oh, my God!

545
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,600
- Well, it doesn't really...
- I'm only at "G."

546
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,160
That's basically everybody in France.

547
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,440
- That's incredible.
- On and on.

548
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,480
I bet the Australian list
is a bit shorter.

549
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,040
I'm staggered.

550
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,400
'Cause you know
in French secondary schools,

551
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,800
it's compulsory to study philosophy.

552
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,720
- For everyone?
- Yeah.

553
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,400
I bring this up because
I've been reading this book by

554
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,760
Roland... Is it "Barth" or "Barthes"?

555
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,280
Waterland boy, which one is it?

556
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,680
That.

557
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,920
And he says,

558
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,920
"I think cars today are almost the exact
equivalent of the great Gothic cathedrals.

559
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,680
"I mean, the supreme creation of an era,

560
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,520
"conceived with passion by artists

561
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,640
"and consumed in image if not in usage

562
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,760
"by a population which appropriates them

563
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,880
"as a purely magical object."

564
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,320
They don't review cars like we do, then.

565
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,160
No. What we tend to do
is mention the top speed.

566
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,960
- Naught to sixty, the price.
- Stick the tail out.

567
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,680
A couple of silly metaphors.

568
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,560
- Back to the studio.
- Job done.

569
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,400
No. I'll give you another bit here
from him.

570
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,640
"They are in the Citroen the beginnings
of a new phenomenology

571
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,920
"of assembling, as if one progressed from
a world where elements were welded

572
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,880
"to a world where they are juxtaposed."

573
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,400
What's the naught to sixty?

574
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,840
He doesn't mention it.

575
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,840
Could you imagine what a review of that
Mégane would look like on French TV?

576
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,360
It'd be completely incomprehensible.

577
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,680
It is truth

578
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,040
So, I think what we're able to deduce
from that French road test

579
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,600
is that the Megane

580
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,000
is wistful and cynical,

581
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,640
but with a hint of levity,

582
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,560
as suggested by that balloon.

583
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,120
Now, though, it's time to examine

584
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,920
a more down-to-earth aspect
of French cars,

585
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,800
namely their famed ride quality.

586
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,080
The elasticity of the air
and the flexibility of water

587
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,360
are combined for your comfort
in the Citroen hydro-pneumatic suspension.

588
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,480
The fact is that because
the roads were so poor

589
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,080
in post-war France,

590
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,440
the French car makers

591
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,920
were forced to develop suspension systems
that could cope.

592
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,160
As I clearly stated earlier,

593
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,480
the Citroen 2CV was
capable of transporting

594
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,360
a basket of eggs across a plowed field

595
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,000
without breaking them.

596
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,440
And as for my CX,

597
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,880
well, it's literally the best-riding car

598
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,520
ever made.

599
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,200
Okay, picture the scene.

600
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,320
You're lying on a day bed
on a tropical beach.

601
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,400
It's warm, and all you can hear are
the wavelets caressing the white sand.

602
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,680
You had half a bottle of wine

603
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,200
at lunch time and there's
nothing to do all afternoon

604
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,960
but snooze.

605
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,280
That is what it's like
to drive a Citroen CX.

606
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,800
It is incredibly comfortable.

607
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,960
In fact, it's said

608
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,360
that the hydro-pneumatic system
in my Citroen is so good

609
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,960
that two people can sit in the boot
and defuse a bomb

610
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,440
while the car is being driven at speed
down a cobbled street.

611
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,960
Are you sure it said that?

612
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,480
Yes, absolutely.

613
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,680
The suspension system in this was so good

614
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,160
Citroen sold it to Rolls-Royce,
who used it in the Shadow.

615
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,640
So, are you ready?

616
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,280
Because we are about to hit
the cobbles, now.

617
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:37,000
Okay, this needs
absolute delicacy and precision.

618
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,680
Yep.

619
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,400
God,
this is like doing eye surgery.

620
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,960
- One wrong move...
- Steady.

621
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,000
Okay, very carefully,

622
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,920
if I just separate these wires,

623
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,960
just a millimeter at a time.

624
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,960
We have to work out...
At least one of them is just a fake.

625
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,080
No sudden jolts.

626
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,160
Eight seconds to go.
I'm gonna have to make a decision.

627
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,880
That's not the car shaking,
that's me.

628
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,160
I should do it now.

629
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,760
I'm gonna do it.

630
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,080
- Have you done it?
- Oh, well done. Yes.

631
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,040
- Excellent. So, there we are.
- Were we moving?

632
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,680
Exactly.

633
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,160
Exactly my point.

634
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,480
And to hammer
the point home still further,

635
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,840
we put the same sort of bomb

636
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,520
in the back of a BMW

637
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,760
and asked two office juniors
to see if they could defuse it.

638
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,680
- Just snip it!
- I can't snip it!

639
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,400
I can't get on the wire!

640
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,880
Hell!

641
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,160
So, there we are.

642
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,160
If you want a job on The Grand Tour,
write to us at

643
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,400
"I'd die for a job on that show."

644
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,320
It's sad, 'cause they were good kids.

645
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,960
I thought they were
gonna go places.

646
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,640
I never wanted to inhale them.

647
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,640
Well, they have...

648
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:35,920
After writing some tricky letters
to the boys' parents...

649
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,840
We headed to Kent for our next
important experiment.

650
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,680
And on the way, we examined
a French characteristic

651
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,480
we very much admire,

652
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,320
their willful refusal to be governed.

653
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,560
De Gaulle once famously asked,

654
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:04,920
"How can you rule a country
that has 246 different types of cheese?"

655
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,600
Well, the truth, it seems is...

656
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,400
You can't.

657
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,680
When we introduced
the points system on driving licenses

658
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,440
in Britain in 1988,

659
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,800
everyone just went, "Okay."

660
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,680
But when they introduced
a similar system in France

661
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,880
in the 1990s,

662
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:31,920
everyone immediately got into their cars
and blockaded the motorways.

663
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,280
That wasn't organized by social media

664
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,760
'cause that didn't exist back then.
It was just instinctive.

665
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,080
When the head of Renault, Georges Besse,

666
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,640
laid off 21,000 staff in 1986,

667
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,120
they didn't go outside
and fire up the brazier.

668
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,440
They shot him.

669
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,360
Back in 2019,

670
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,280
the French government decided to
reduce the speed limit

671
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,640
on all their major A roads
to 50 miles an hour.

672
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,960
The French people responded
by putting their yellow vests on...

673
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,080
And then going out and destroying

674
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:22,560
60 percent of the speed cameras
in the whole country.

675
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,040
Sixty percent!

676
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,320
And when they put cameras on porticos
over the autoroute

677
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,960
to catch truckers breaking
some new eco law,

678
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,360
they didn't destroy 60 percent of them,

679
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,320
they destroyed the lot.

680
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,080
I'm just thinking, I quite admire

681
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,120
the French bloody-mindedness, you know.

682
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,680
I absolutely love it.

683
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,920
Is it true that when they tried to
introduce wheel clamps,

684
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,360
people just filled the locks with glue

685
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,160
so they had to be cut away
and were useless?

686
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,800
If I was French now,
I'd be a doing 120 miles an hour.

687
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,800
I wish my car could do
120 miles an hour.

688
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,080
Soon, we arrived at
the rally cross circuit

689
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,880
known as Lydden Hill.

690
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,440
The laboratory for our next experiment.

691
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,360
Oh.

692
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,000
We all know that
when it comes to hot hatches,

693
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,840
the French are the kings.

694
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,800
But which one is the best?

695
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,760
Well, that's what we're here to find out,
using the crucible of motorsport.

696
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,280
That seems fitting as the French
pretty much invented motorsport.

697
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,440
The first ever race was held there.

698
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,880
Grand Prix are French words.
Le Mans is in France.

699
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,000
The governing body of all world motorsport
is based in Paris.

700
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:31,040
And certainly today,
we shall be adhering to French rules.

701
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,520
The plan is simple. A 20-lap race.

702
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,440
I shall be driving
a Peugeot 205 GTi 1.6.

703
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,520
Jeremy, a Peugeot 306, GTi 6.

704
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:53,840
And James will be driving
a Renault Sport Clio 172 Cup.

705
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,880
We will be up against a Saxo VTS,

706
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,520
a 206 GTi,

707
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,840
and a Renault Sport Mégane

708
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:13,120
which will be driven by
three people from the office.

709
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:16,680
Our script editor,
because he wrote this bit,

710
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,520
our production assistant,
because she's French,

711
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:24,280
and finally, Abbie,
our in-house racing driver.

712
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,880
With all of us in our cars...

713
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,560
The important experiment
could finally begin.

714
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,080
We are away.

715
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,360
Lunch, I think.

716
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,280
Over in the paddock,
some simple track-side food was available.

717
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,440
James, do you want
a Châteauneuf-du-Pape or a Petrus '62?

718
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,520
In the middle of a race?

719
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,120
Well, no, you say that,

720
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,120
but in France, alcohol is banned
in the workplace, you're right,

721
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,040
but you are allowed to drink wine,

722
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,920
beer or brandy.

723
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,280
So, they said, "You cannot drink alcohol
apart from beer,

724
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,720
- "wine and brandy."
- "Which is what we make."

725
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,840
- You can't drink gin or vodka.
- Yeah. Foreign alcohol.

726
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,640
Yes.

727
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,520
My favorite law in France is the one

728
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,560
that prevents you from sending
work emails at a weekend.

729
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,800
- You're not allowed to?
- By law.

730
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,600
So you can enjoy le weekend?

731
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,600
Yeah. Exactly that.

732
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:21,200
Can I just say, I'm currently
in second place in this race.

733
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,760
I'm last. I messed up the start...

734
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,280
I've told you before,
a 205 GTi, great car,

735
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,920
but not as great as the 306 GTi.

736
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,520
Yeah, because the world agrees
with that theory.

737
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:37,640
Oh, no, wait, everybody agrees
the 205 is the definitive hot hatch.

738
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:42,040
- I agree, it is a definitive hot hatch.
- It can't be a definitive hot hatch.

739
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,200
- It's the...
- But very few people realize

740
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,320
the 306 GTi, the one I'm driving,

741
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,680
is actually the best French hot hatch
of them all.

742
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,040
Word about that
somehow didn't get out?

743
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,960
- Nobody realizes.
- Therefore...

744
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,120
It's like the Sex Pistols
and the New York Dolls.

745
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,200
After lunch was over
and we'd had a little nap,

746
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,960
the race resumed.

747
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,080
We are away.

748
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,800
This is tight.

749
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,080
Now I'm eating proper French dust.

750
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:27,000
Come on, come on.
Oh, deary me.

751
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:31,320
Marguerite,
a French intern, in the 206 GTi.

752
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,600
But just as
things were hotting up,

753
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,200
there was a problem.

754
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,360
Wait a minute. What's going on here?

755
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:47,080
What's happenin'?

756
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,800
Well, it looks like
the marshals have gone on strike.

757
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,040
In the confusion, James took
the opportunity to make up three places.

758
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,600
Liberté!
Liberté! Liberté! Liberté!

759
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,880
Oh, dear, there's a lot of bother
going on, look.

760
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,240
What could they have gone on strike about?

761
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,160
It's always difficult to know
with the French.

762
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,000
Fishing quotas, land,

763
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:25,800
speed cameras.

764
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,120
This just feels like home.

765
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,600
Eventually, though,
after the race director had been murdered,

766
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,280
they went back to their posts
so the race could begin again.

767
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:54,280
Right, just to be absolutely clear,
all the cars here are excellent

768
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,840
because they're all French hot hatchbacks.

769
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,320
But mine is the best.

770
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,400
It's got no ABS, it's got
no traction control, and I've spun!

771
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,400
Seven thousand RPM.

772
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:17,160
Hundred and sixty seven
horsepowers unleashed!

773
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:24,440
Richard Hammond will now be moaning
about a lack of horsepower.

774
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:31,280
Now, I am down on power.
I only have 104 brake horsepower.

775
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,840
Porter completely killed me.

776
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,120
That was a very French move
from the scriptwriter there.

777
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,640
Out of the way!
Out of the way!

778
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,960
Oh, it's her! The French woman.

779
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:55,600
I ought to point out that Marguerite's
never really done this before,

780
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,200
so she is a natural French lunatic.

781
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,880
Although she did make a slight error there
and I'll hammer her.

782
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,440
Bonjour, madame!

783
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,360
Whoa!

784
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,040
As Hammond and May
battled with the office staff,

785
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,640
Abbie and I were up front
fighting for the lead.

786
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,360
Determined face.

787
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,720
Speed!

788
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,120
You may be a racing driver, but I've got
40 more horsepower than you.

789
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,000
Oh, no. Hang on.

790
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,160
Ah. Think my dash appears
to be coming off,

791
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,720
but I'd say that wasn't necessary.

792
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,520
French cars tend to shed
the stuff you can lose.

793
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:03,520
Bumpers, electric windows,
all that sort of stuff.

794
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:07,920
What you're left with is, actually,
an incredibly tough drivetrain, engine.

795
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,680
Whoa. Monsieur Le Porter.

796
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,360
Right, this is my chance.

797
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,560
Ooh, ! Not my chance.

798
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:33,560
Yep, she gave me the finger.
She is definitely a French woman.

799
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,400
That's the real deal there.

800
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,200
God, this thing's so good.

801
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,040
Oh, she's cocked it up!

802
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,320
You son of a female dog!

803
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,520
Go away in a reproductive manner.

804
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:09,920
Whoa!

805
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,360
As we entered the closing laps,

806
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:17,320
I finally overtook James'
much more powerful Renault.

807
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,640
Stealing a line from James then.
"Come on, little Pug."

808
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,640
But then...

809
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,640
Oh!

810
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:29,880
I've died.

811
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,120
What's happened here?

812
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,840
Oh, dear.

813
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,320
It's gone on strike.

814
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:45,880
As the race entered
the final two laps,

815
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,600
James was still being humiliated

816
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,560
by the brilliantly-entertaining
French novice.

817
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,480
And I was still fighting
Abbie for the win.

818
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,200
AND BEFORE YOU JUMP ON TWITTER,

819
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,960
YES, WE KNOW HE'S BELGIAN.

820
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,320
Damn it!

821
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,000
Oh, balls!

822
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,280
Whoa!

823
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:35,200
Yes. The mighty Peugeot is in the lead!

824
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,840
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on! Come on!

825
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,800
No!

826
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,600
So, the Saxo won.

827
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,120
But it doesn't matter

828
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:09,080
because all of us
had had so much fun.

829
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,720
And...

830
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,160
we'd made an important point.

831
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:20,440
The French can make spectacular cars
when they're not being bonkers.

832
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,160
But here's the thing.

833
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,720
Sometimes they can make spectacular cars

834
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,240
when they are.

835
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,160
CITROЁN SM

836
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:56,000
Welcome, everyone, to the most
magnificent French car of them all.

837
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,680
The SM.

838
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,520
A Citroen coupé with a 2.7 liter

839
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,960
Maserati V-6 under the bonnet.

840
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,880
This, in essence, really,
is Franco-Italian.

841
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,640
And that can work.

842
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,680
Jean Alesi, he's Franco-Italian,

843
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,680
so is Olivier Giroud, Eric Cantona,
David Ginola.

844
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,840
That worked well.

845
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,160
Yeah.
So what you got in one of these

846
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,080
was French complexity
and Italian fragility.

847
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,200
Yeah. Yeah.

848
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:38,440
To give you an example of the complexity,
it doesn't have a throttle linkage,

849
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,040
as such. Well, it does,

850
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,360
but you get a rod, then a bit of cable,

851
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,160
then another rod, then it goes through
the exhaust.

852
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,560
It does.

853
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,880
- And then it comes out.
- It's basically engine-out.

854
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:53,920
And here's another good one,
all the wiring under the bonnet is black,

855
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,080
so you've no idea where it's going
or where it came from.

856
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:59,480
It's just all black. I don't know.

857
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,440
They don't really work.

858
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,880
I love the "stop" light there.

859
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,640
The biggest stop sign.

860
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:08,760
- Yeah, it doesn't even...
- "Just stop!"

861
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:11,640
"One of a number of things
has gone wrong again."

862
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:13,640
That's what it says.

863
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,200
"This is a really big light to
tell you, inevitably, stop."

864
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,720
"What did you expect?

865
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,440
"Here is the moment you knew was coming.

866
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,760
"And you must stop instantly or die."

867
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,480
But... can we just mention the looks?

868
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:35,160
It's one of the best-looking
cars ever made.

869
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,200
Some angles, there's
a sort of gawkiness to it,

870
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:45,440
which is, I know we've said it before,
but real, true beauty isn't just

871
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,720
- that sort of Internet, fake...
- No.

872
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,400
perfectly-symmetrical.
This has an angularity to it.

873
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,560
Oh, it's stunning.

874
00:57:55,400 --> 00:58:00,000
I'll tell you what I love,
is the list of people who owned an SM.

875
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,400
- Is it good?
- Oh, eclectic.

876
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:06,480
You've got Graham Greene, Brezhnev,

877
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:07,800
Haile Selassie,

878
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:11,000
Lee Majors, The Six Million Dollar Man,
John Barry,

879
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,840
the guy who wrote the Bond stuff.

880
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,320
Idi Amin had seven of them.

881
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,280
Seven SMs.

882
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,640
Just on the off-chance
one of them worked.

883
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,800
But this is
the really interesting one.

884
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,600
Bill Wyman from The Stones,

885
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,800
okay, Adam Clayton from U2

886
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,880
and Guy Berryman from Coldplay.

887
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,800
They're all bassists and they all had SMs.

888
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:34,720
That's because nobody ever
looks at the bassists.

889
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,760
They're always standing at the back.

890
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,760
"Stop looking at the lead singer.

891
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:41,040
- "I've got a sodding SM."
- "Look at me!"

892
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:42,240
Yes!

893
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,640
- I love this car.
- I really want one.

894
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,800
I can feel the vibe of a man
wanting something coming from over there.

895
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:01,400
And I think you should have one
so I can look at it.

896
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,840
It's so special.

897
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:07,240
And I wanna be the kind of
person that would,

898
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,920
well, set out

899
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,680
- to turn up in one.
- Yeah, you'd never get there.

900
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,520
- No.
- But you'd be an optimist.

901
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,760
People would see you

902
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,320
and assume you were just
an optimistic idiot.

903
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,080
- Yes.
- Which I kind of am.

904
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,440
You know,
we started out by asking,

905
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,800
"What is the matter with the French?"

906
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,760
And the answer is,

907
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:39,080
not much, not really.

908
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:43,560
We like their food, their wine,
their bloody-mindedness,

909
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:44,880
and, it turns out,

910
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,320
we like a lot of their cars as well.

911
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:05,200
But we don't want you to get
the impression we like all of them.

912
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,640
Because we don't.

913
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:13,360
This is the Citroen Pluriel,
which we hate,

914
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,880
partly because it's horrid, but mainly...

915
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:18,720
because of its stupid roof.

916
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,480
Now, you probably think the roof
has folded away cleverly

917
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:28,040
like it does with a normal convertible.

918
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,160
But it hasn't.

919
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,040
It's right here.

920
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,600
You have to take it off entirely.

921
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:37,680
If you get up in the morning and think,
"It's sunny, I'll take the roof off"

922
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,600
and then it starts raining,
what do you do?

923
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,640
What if you set off and you think,

924
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,920
"The sun's come out,
I'll take the roof off",

925
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,840
where do you put it?
It is genuine French idiocy.

926
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,600
We should send that
miserable thing back to France

927
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,320
and tell them to keep it.

928
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,480
It's funny you should say that
'cause France is, what,

929
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,360
25 miles away? You can
virtually see it from here.

930
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,760
- It's not far, is it?
- No.

931
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:07,640
If only we had something
that could fling it that far.

932
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,880
Wait a minute!

933
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,040
Oh, yeah!

934
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:31,080
At more than 60 feet tall
and weighing 32 tons,

935
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:34,560
our trebuchet was certainly
big enough for the job.

936
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:39,880
However, it's quite a faff
to load and cock it,

937
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:43,480
which means bringing in some machinery.

938
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,240
KATO

939
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:49,600
Oh, yes.

940
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,560
I love cranes, me.

941
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:56,840
Where's James?

942
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:01,680
Hang on.

943
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:21,360
Having moved faster
than he had done at any point in the show,

944
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,640
James then set about
attaching the trebuchet

945
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,320
to the hook on Hammond's crane.

946
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:29,680
Thank you.

947
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,920
He is wearing a harness,
isn't he?

948
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,600
Oh, of course.
He's more than six feet up.

949
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,320
- Are you hooked?
- Are we on?

950
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:38,760
Yeah.

951
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:42,080
With that done,
we needed someone practical

952
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:45,960
to explain the engineering
behind our incredible machine.

953
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,320
Right, so here's how it works.

954
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:52,800
Hammond will lift this up, and this...

955
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:55,440
12-ton weight

956
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,520
will go...

957
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,440
Or will it go that way?

958
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:06,040
No, this way.

959
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,760
The arm will come down,

960
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:12,520
and then we attach the cable
to the end of the arm...

961
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,400
to the car?

962
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,440
With all that cleared up,

963
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,720
he went off to get the Pluriel.

964
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,000
What are you doing?

965
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:33,040
- It goes at the other end.
- Jeremy, that's the wrong end!

966
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,520
- What?
- It's in the wrong place.

967
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,280
It's gotta be at the other end.

968
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:40,200
No, France is that way.

969
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,640
It's pulled underneath
and then goes over.

970
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,920
- It starts that side.
- So then it goes...

971
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,720
- Like that.
- It doesn't start here?

972
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,320
No. It starts over there.

973
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:54,960
No!

974
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:57,680
Oh, quality work.

975
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:02,480
That's it. No, it isn't.

976
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:04,120
Genius.

977
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,400
- Hasn't he got one of these at home?
- Yeah.

978
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:09,120
Whoops.

979
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:15,520
Yeah, that's better.

980
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,760
- When a heart surgeon finishes the job...
- Yeah?

981
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:25,400
Attach an artery to an artery

982
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:28,080
and then they stitch it,
it doesn't look like this.

983
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,240
What?

984
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,920
That's clearly not precision
work been taking place, has it?

985
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:40,400
Yes.

986
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,720
Just pickin' it up!

987
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,080
- Stop.
- Stop. Stop. Stop.

988
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,400
God, this is complicated!

989
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:08,760
Stop.

990
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:13,400
It turns out we three are pretty manly.

991
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,600
Oh, yeah!

992
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,400
With the, um, heavy bit

993
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:23,480
lifted into position and the car attached

994
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,080
to something important,

995
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:28,400
we were finally ready for launch.

996
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,760
So the car, when I pull this,
goes round, loops round

997
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,200
- and goes to France?
- Yep.

998
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:35,656
- Exactly.
- And if it works,

999
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,560
it'll be the fastest Pluriel ever.

1000
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,120
By a long way.

1001
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:40,960
Are we all ready?

1002
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,440
Take up the slack.

1003
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:49,800
Here he comes.

1004
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:53,160
- That happens.
- Taking up some more slack.

1005
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:56,760
Manly, you know.

1006
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:58,560
Here he comes again.

1007
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,240
- Keep, keep...
- It's elastic.

1008
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:04,440
Oh.

1009
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:06,520
- We've got the wrong rope.
- I'll go,

1010
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,640
"Three, two, one," do it,
we give it a...

1011
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,720
Ready? Three, two, one.

1012
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,280
There it goes!

1013
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,480
- Whoa!
- There it goes!

1014
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,480
Yes!

1015
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,840
PluRiel

1016
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,560
Oh, good, there it is. I've got it,
I've got it. There it is. Geez.

1017
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:36,920
Hang on.

1018
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,520
Where's it gone? Anyone see it?

1019
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:41,920
There!

1020
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:48,880
Oh, shit.

1021
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:00,040
Right, well, on that
terrible disappointment...

1022
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,160
For Louis.

1023
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:02,600
- Who's Louis?
- Him.

1024
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,200
For Louis, it's time to end.

1025
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:07,680
Thank you so much for watching.

1026
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,040
We'll see you next time. Take care.

1027
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:13,280
- Won't be in France, though, will we?
- No, no, maybe not for a bit.

1028
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:14,400
No.

1029
01:07:16,504 --> 01:07:18,504
