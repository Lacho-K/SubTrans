I've got a hard cider
and a bag of Crossbone Crunch.

18
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,796
It's a party.

19
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,796
I'm... I'm just so,
so thrilled for you, Kate.

20
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,421
To Comet Dibiasky, right? Cheers!

21
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:22,921
It's gotta be, look...
It's gotta be an Oort cloud comet

22
00:03:23,005 --> 00:03:24,838
just based on where you saw it.

23
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:27,088
Probably the last time
it was this close to the Sun

24
00:03:27,171 --> 00:03:29,380
was long before human civilization.

25
00:03:29,463 --> 00:03:31,546
Look at the arc on that thing.
God, it's amazing.

26
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,088
How would we find out the comet's
velocity in orbit, Professor Mindy?

27
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:37,255
That is a good question.

28
00:03:37,338 --> 00:03:40,171
This will be fun. I haven't done
orbital dynamics since grad school.

29
00:03:40,796 --> 00:03:42,005
Question is, what...

30
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:45,380
What would Carl Sagan do?

31
00:03:45,463 --> 00:03:48,880
He would take it back to first principles.

32
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:52,671
The topocentric vector is rho.

33
00:03:54,546 --> 00:03:56,505
Kate, what are the initial coordinates?

34
00:03:57,088 --> 00:03:58,088
Twenty-one.

35
00:03:59,671 --> 00:04:00,880
Twenty-four.

36
00:04:01,546 --> 00:04:02,546
Thirteen.

37
00:04:02,588 --> 00:04:04,255
This is fun, huh, guys?

38
00:04:04,338 --> 00:04:07,463
- Sixty-seven.
- Wow. Now you got me pumped.

39
00:04:07,546 --> 00:04:08,856
- Dr. Mindy.
- All right...

40
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,588
How many terms do you have to calibrate...

41
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:13,463
Approximation
of coordinates in Marsden, '85.

42
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,963
Now that we have the comet's orbit,
we will check the ephemeris

43
00:04:18,046 --> 00:04:22,463
and that will give us the distance
between the comet and planet Earth.

44
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,088
Why does the ephemeris
keep getting lower and lower?

45
00:04:42,713 --> 00:04:43,838
Professor Mindy?

46
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:50,630
Professor Mindy?

47
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:58,046
You know what, guys? Let's...

48
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,463
Let's call it a night, huh?

49
00:05:02,838 --> 00:05:04,921
But what about
the relative position?

50
00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:08,505
I can't figure this one out.
Not tonight, guys. Sorry.

51
00:05:09,296 --> 00:05:11,880
- Let's hit it, man. I'm beat.
- Me too.

52
00:05:12,505 --> 00:05:15,380
- Kate, this was amazing.
- Congratulations.

53
00:05:16,005 --> 00:05:17,005
Hey, Kate.

54
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:19,671
You stay.

55
00:05:30,088 --> 00:05:31,713
Yeah, uh, Dr. Calder,

56
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:33,921
a Michigan State professor
and his grad students...

57
00:05:34,005 --> 00:05:36,380
This is Dr. Calder.
You pulled me out of a meeting

58
00:05:36,463 --> 00:05:39,296
where I had to tell my team
we lost eight billion in funding.

59
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,213
I am so sorry, Dr. Calder,

60
00:05:42,296 --> 00:05:45,130
but we are seeing some
awfully strange orbital numbers

61
00:05:45,213 --> 00:05:47,046
on this comet we just found.

62
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,963
They should be in your inbox, right?

63
00:05:49,046 --> 00:05:50,921
- Is this it?
- Yeah. This is it.

64
00:05:51,005 --> 00:05:53,380
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let me get
Dr. Oglethorpe on the line.

65
00:05:53,463 --> 00:05:54,796
<i>Please hold.</i>

66
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,255
Uh... Uh, I'm on hold.

67
00:05:57,338 --> 00:06:00,505
She's calling a Dr. Oglethorpe.
Who is that?

68
00:06:01,338 --> 00:06:04,088
Jesus Christ.
I'm gonna put them on speaker.

69
00:06:06,046 --> 00:06:07,171
"Dr. Oglethorpe,

70
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:10,671
head of the Planetary
Defense Coordination Office."

71
00:06:10,755 --> 00:06:12,630
- Is that a real place?
- I have no idea.

72
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,630
<i>This is Dr. Oglethorpe.</i>

73
00:06:22,713 --> 00:06:24,213
<i>Yes, this is Jocelyn Calder</i>

74
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:25,380
from Kennedy Space Center.

75
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:27,005
Hey, Jocelyn.

76
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:29,130
<i>Listen, we got a sighting</i>

77
00:06:29,213 --> 00:06:31,505
of an NEO from Subaru telescope.

78
00:06:31,588 --> 00:06:32,921
<i>Okay. Uh...</i>

79
00:06:33,005 --> 00:06:35,463
Why you just didn't report it
to the Minor Planet Center?

80
00:06:35,546 --> 00:06:38,338
<i>It's a professor
and a bunch of Michigan State students</i>

81
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:40,338
<i>who identified something big.</i>

82
00:06:40,421 --> 00:06:41,838
Really? How large?

83
00:06:41,921 --> 00:06:43,296
<i>How big we talking?</i>

84
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,671
<i>We clocked it in around
five to ten kilometers wide.</i>

85
00:06:45,755 --> 00:06:47,255
About five to ten kilometers wide.

86
00:06:48,255 --> 00:06:49,755
Uh... That's a big boy.

87
00:06:51,046 --> 00:06:55,296
And, uh, was this professor the one
who first made the observations?

88
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,630
Hi, yes. Uh, Dr. Mindy.

89
00:06:57,713 --> 00:07:01,088
And... And no,
PhD candidate Kate Dibiasky found it.

90
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,921
I did the orbital calculations.

91
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,255
I, uh... I study trace gasses
in dead galaxies.

92
00:07:07,338 --> 00:07:10,755
I haven't published in a while
so you probably haven't heard of me.

93
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:11,981
But anyway, that doesn't matter.

94
00:07:12,005 --> 00:07:14,338
<i>Sorry. What was your question?</i>

95
00:07:14,421 --> 00:07:17,380
What are the most updated estimates
on its trajectory?

96
00:07:17,463 --> 00:07:18,463
Kate?

97
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,630
Um...

98
00:07:22,963 --> 00:07:27,046
I've been running it all day.
I keep getting the same result.

99
00:07:27,796 --> 00:07:30,880
A direct hit of Earth
in six months and 14 days.

100
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,005
Me too.

101
00:07:33,088 --> 00:07:35,338
<i>Matthew,
what are your calculations?</i>

102
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:40,505
<i>Um, Scout program
is saying six months, 14 days.</i>

103
00:07:40,588 --> 00:07:42,796
<i>We got six months and 14 days.</i>

104
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,921
And it's roughly five
to ten kilometers wide.

105
00:07:49,005 --> 00:07:51,130
Which... Which, uh...

106
00:07:52,255 --> 00:07:53,630
<i>Isn't that...</i>

107
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,088
an extinction-level event?

108
00:07:57,213 --> 00:07:59,338
Well, let's not be dramatic here.

109
00:08:01,505 --> 00:08:02,546
Okay, uh...

110
00:08:03,255 --> 00:08:07,296
First move is to get
the school field trip out here to DC.

111
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,838
<i>Let's all calm down.</i>

112
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,171
<i>I need the person who first had eyes
on the comet</i>

113
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:12,755
and the person in charge.

114
00:08:12,838 --> 00:08:13,838
What?

115
00:08:16,921 --> 00:08:21,213
...share this data immediately
with Cambridge, Caltech and IAU.

116
00:08:21,296 --> 00:08:23,296
Wait a minute.
This is classified information.

117
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,713
What's happening?

118
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,838
<i>I serve
at the discretion of the president.</i>

119
00:08:26,921 --> 00:08:28,171
Is this really happening?

120
00:08:28,255 --> 00:08:30,671
...and the dead galaxy professor
to Hickam Air Force base.

121
00:08:30,755 --> 00:08:33,296
DC, right?
Hey! Hey, Kate.

122
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,296
<i>This isn't happening, right?</i>

123
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,546
Kate, this isn't real,
right? This is, uh...

124
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,130
This is just some sort
of alternate reality, right?

125
00:08:41,213 --> 00:08:42,046
<i>Say something.</i>

126
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,755
I gotta go get high.

127
00:08:43,838 --> 00:08:48,046
Word is that I need you both in DC fast.
Only plane I got going there is that one.

128
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:50,380
Anyway, I am Dr. Mindy. This is...

129
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,213
- Hi! Oh.
- Go, go, go!

130
00:08:54,838 --> 00:08:57,713
- Where do we sit, Kate?
- I have no idea.

131
00:08:57,796 --> 00:08:59,630
Is there
any customary seating for...

132
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:10,630
What the fuck? Is this real?
Is this a goddamn joke?

133
00:09:10,713 --> 00:09:11,838
Holy shit.

134
00:09:18,463 --> 00:09:21,005
This can't be happening. No.

135
00:10:09,171 --> 00:10:11,130
- Brendon. You mean Brendon?
- Yeah, Brendon.

136
00:10:11,213 --> 00:10:15,046
You know, he didn't keep his head down.
It's all politics, Teddy. You know that.

137
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,088
You must be Randall and Kate.

138
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:18,255
Yes. Yes, hi.

139
00:10:18,338 --> 00:10:20,588
I'm Dr. Oglethorpe,
but you can call me Teddy.

140
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:22,171
I'm sorry. Did you say your name...

141
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:25,338
- I should call you "Teddy"? Teddy.
- Teddy. Yeah.

142
00:10:25,421 --> 00:10:28,088
Yeah, we call him Teddy
because he ain't no teddy bear.

143
00:10:29,005 --> 00:10:31,421
General Themes.
I'm the Pentagon's eyes on, uh,

144
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,380
you know, whatever this turns out to be.

145
00:10:33,463 --> 00:10:37,880
The president is famously late,
and you've had a long flight, so...

146
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:44,255
- Michigan State Spartans.
- Mmm.

147
00:10:48,921 --> 00:10:52,588
- Is that the Oval Office?
- Yeah, that's the Oval Office, yeah.

148
00:10:53,463 --> 00:10:55,546
It's a lot smaller
than in the photographs.

149
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,630
The president
should be here shortly.

150
00:10:57,713 --> 00:10:58,880
She's already been briefed.

151
00:10:58,963 --> 00:11:00,463
Correct, Scott?

152
00:11:02,046 --> 00:11:03,171
That is correct.

153
00:11:03,255 --> 00:11:05,755
Are we really about to tell
the president of the United States

154
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:07,588
that we have just over six months

155
00:11:07,671 --> 00:11:12,171
until humankind, basically every species,
is completely extinct?

156
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:16,296
Yeah. That's exactly
what we're about to do. Yeah.

157
00:11:21,921 --> 00:11:23,921
Oh, gosh. Oh, gosh.

158
00:12:13,546 --> 00:12:15,421
Yes, I said law enforcement.

159
00:12:15,505 --> 00:12:18,713
But I didn't want... I mean,
you told me that he was clean.

- Step back, please.

161
00:12:24,255 --> 00:12:25,671
Hello.

162
00:12:25,755 --> 00:12:30,213
Madam President, I'm Dr. Oglethorpe.
I believe Jocelyn briefed you to...

163
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:32,838
- Hey, Jason.
- Yeah? What up, yo?

164
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:35,171
Come on, man. What the hell?
This is real world.

165
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,880
Yeah. I know. We need five minutes.

166
00:12:36,963 --> 00:12:40,630
We have a problem with our Supreme Court
nominee. Five minutes. Thank you.

and then, stuff like this happens,

00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:13,505
and I don't know what's going on.

172
00:13:14,838 --> 00:13:17,546
I don't understand
how many more times I need to tell you...

173
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,505
Well, there's a bunch of stuff about
their nominee not being qualified,

174
00:13:22,796 --> 00:13:25,880
but I don't see
any articles about our thing.

175
00:13:25,963 --> 00:13:28,296
Social media is just going on and on

176
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,255
about that singer Riley Bina
and DJ Chello breaking up.

177
00:13:33,463 --> 00:13:35,171
That's just too bad.

Hmm. I don't... I don't know them.

Which is...

181
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:44,380
- It's a shame though.
- Yeah.

182
00:13:44,463 --> 00:13:46,630
- Do you know them, Kate?
- Yes.

183
00:13:46,713 --> 00:13:49,421
- But I don't really give a shit right now.
- Oh.

184
00:13:51,213 --> 00:13:53,213
They charge
an arm and a leg for this stuff.

185
00:13:53,296 --> 00:13:55,046
- Ten apiece ought to do it.
- Oh.

186
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:56,630
- Grab a water.
- Thank you.

187
00:13:56,713 --> 00:13:57,921
I've got Kate as well.

188
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:59,255
- Perfect.
- Thank you.

189
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,005
- Here's a 20.
- Oh.

190
00:14:03,421 --> 00:14:05,338
- You got change?
- No.

191
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,213
- I mean, I could ask the Marine.
- Yeah...

192
00:14:12,921 --> 00:14:14,630
Uh, it's a Xanax.

193
00:14:14,713 --> 00:14:17,755
- I only take a quarter. Otherwise I get...
- Ah...

- Kate.

Yes, it's the White House.

He charged us
for the snacks, but they're free.

00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,421
Oh, gosh.

212
00:15:29,505 --> 00:15:31,546
Why on earth would he do that?

213
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,296
Hey, peeps, uh, it's not looking
like it's gonna happen tonight,

214
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,296
and I feel horrible.

We're gonna put you up
in a hotel somewhere.

216
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,546
Excuse me, does the president
know why we're here?

217
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,921
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

218
00:15:44,005 --> 00:15:46,171
They must not know
why we're here, right?

219
00:15:46,255 --> 00:15:47,880
They know. Uh, but you heard 'em.

220
00:15:47,963 --> 00:15:50,356
- Do they even realize...
- Be ready for tomorrow.

221
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,772
...how long it took for us to get...

222
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:57,713
And then they made us wait
for over seven hours,

223
00:15:57,796 --> 00:15:59,921
but they never called us in.
I couldn't believe it.

224
00:16:00,005 --> 00:16:03,505
Of course they didn't call you in.
Kate, have you watched any news today?

225
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:06,963
No, I've been pretty wrapped up
in our... project.

226
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:08,505
Turn on your TV right now.

227
00:16:08,588 --> 00:16:11,255
President Orlean is in
the middle of an all-time shit storm.

228
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,171
<i>Sheriff Wade Conlon
was already a controversial nominee,</i>

229
00:16:15,255 --> 00:16:19,963
<i>with no law degree and a record
of "shoot first and ask questions later."</i>

230
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,130
You watching?

231
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:23,255
<i>With his background as a nude life model...</i>

232
00:16:23,338 --> 00:16:25,755
Yeah, I'm watching it right now.

233
00:16:25,838 --> 00:16:28,255
<i>...the White House is in full crisis mode.</i>

234
00:16:28,338 --> 00:16:29,505
<i>And, get this.</i>

235
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:32,755
I found five former students

236
00:16:32,838 --> 00:16:37,671
who are willing to go on record
that Conlon got noticeably aroused

237
00:16:37,755 --> 00:16:39,380
when he posed for their drawing class.

238
00:16:39,463 --> 00:16:40,921
<i>I have no shame in what I did.</i>

239
00:16:41,005 --> 00:16:43,921
Now, should I say "noticeably aroused"?

240
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,921
Or "engorged"? Because
I don't want this to read like clickbait.

241
00:16:48,005 --> 00:16:49,713
<i>You know, this is a real article.</i>

242
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:54,296
I just... Kate, can I get
something from you, please?

243
00:16:55,088 --> 00:16:56,255
Sorry.

244
00:16:57,088 --> 00:17:00,088
- Out of sorts tonight.
<i>- Can we have this conversation?</i>

245
00:17:00,171 --> 00:17:02,088
I feel like we're skirting around this.

246
00:17:02,171 --> 00:17:05,005
Do you have an issue with my mom?
Is that what this is all about?

247
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:07,796
<i>You can't tell me what's going on?</i>

248
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,463
It's just the protocol.
Please, don't worry.

249
00:17:10,546 --> 00:17:15,213

<i>He's a solid four.</i>

255
00:17:28,171 --> 00:17:30,755
Well, that's better
than last month, right?

256
00:17:30,838 --> 00:17:34,088
You know, just remember to speak up
in the meeting tomorrow. Okay?

257
00:17:34,171 --> 00:17:35,755
- Yeah. I will.
<i>- You get so quiet.</i>

258
00:17:35,838 --> 00:17:38,421
When it's time to take credit,
you kind of...

259
00:17:38,505 --> 00:17:43,005
She <i>asked</i> you if you were a lesbian.
She did not say that you <i>were</i> a lesbian.

260
00:17:43,088 --> 00:17:44,921
- It was a question.
- Hey, look, I'm...

261
00:17:45,005 --> 00:17:48,213
Can I sit down with your mom
to have lunch in, like, seven months?

262
00:17:48,296 --> 00:17:52,588
Seven... That's weirdly
specific and distant.

263
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:54,630
<i>What is... This is my mom.</i>

264
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:02,546
So... Oh!

265
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:06,046
I heard there's an asteroid
or a comet or something

266
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,963
that you don't like the looks of.

267
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:12,421
Tell me about it and then
tell me why you're telling me about it.

268
00:18:12,505 --> 00:18:14,213
You got 20 minutes.

269
00:18:14,296 --> 00:18:16,213
- Twenty minutes?
- That's you, Doc.

270
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:18,380
Go. Now. Go.

271
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:20,005
Uh...

272
00:18:20,088 --> 00:18:22,130
Madam President.

273
00:18:22,213 --> 00:18:23,671
Uh...

274
00:18:23,755 --> 00:18:27,130
Approximately 36 hours ago,

275
00:18:27,213 --> 00:18:31,796
uh, PhD candidate
Kate Dibiasky here discovered

276
00:18:32,463 --> 00:18:34,005
a very large comet.

277
00:18:34,088 --> 00:18:34,921
Oh.

278
00:18:35,005 --> 00:18:36,796
- Yeah.
- Good for you.

279
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,546
A comet between
five to ten kilometers across,

280
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,880
that we estimate came from the, uh...

281
00:18:41,963 --> 00:18:44,255
from the... from the Oort cloud.

282
00:18:44,338 --> 00:18:45,213
Wow.

283
00:18:45,296 --> 00:18:47,796
Which is the outermost part
of the solar system.

284
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:49,463
And, um...

285
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,421
And using Gauss's method
of orbital determination

286
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:58,630
and the average astrometric uncertainty
of 0.04 arcseconds, we then asked...

287
00:18:58,713 --> 00:19:03,005
- Whoa! What the hell is... What?
- I'm so bored. Just tell us what it is.

288
00:19:03,088 --> 00:19:05,296
- What? Stop what?
- Seriously, stop.

289
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,421
What Dr. Mindy is trying to say is
there's a comet headed towards Earth,

290
00:19:08,505 --> 00:19:10,713
and according to NASA's computers,

291
00:19:10,796 --> 00:19:12,921
that object is gonna hit the Pacific Ocean

292
00:19:13,005 --> 00:19:15,171
at 62 miles due west
off the coast of Chile.

293
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,171
Then what happens? Like, a tidal wave?

294
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:20,671
No. It will be far more catastrophic.

295
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:25,255
There'll be mile-high tsunamis
fanning out all across the globe.

296
00:19:26,296 --> 00:19:32,338
If this comet makes impact, it will have
the power of a billion Hiroshima bombs.

297
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:36,380
There'll be
magnitude 10 or 11 earthquakes...

298
00:19:36,463 --> 00:19:39,380
You're breathing weird.
It's, uh, making me uncomfortable.

299
00:19:39,463 --> 00:19:42,005
I'm sorry, I'm just trying
to articulate the science.

300
00:19:42,088 --> 00:19:45,130
I know. But it's so stressful.
I'm trying to, like, listen...

301
00:19:45,213 --> 00:19:47,921
I don't think you understand
the gravity of the situation.

302
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:49,880
I'm trying to articulate it
the best I can...

303
00:19:49,963 --> 00:19:54,796
Madam President, this comet
is what we call a planet-killer.

304
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,338
That is correct.

305
00:19:58,796 --> 00:19:59,880
Mmm-hmm.

306
00:20:00,796 --> 00:20:02,338
So how certain is this?

307
00:20:02,421 --> 00:20:05,546
There's 100% certainty of impact.

308
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,671
Please, don't say 100%.

309
00:20:07,755 --> 00:20:10,338
Can we just call it
a potentially significant event?

310
00:20:10,421 --> 00:20:11,463
- Yeah.
- Yes.

311
00:20:11,546 --> 00:20:14,255
But it isn't<i> potentially</i> going to happen.

312
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,505
It <i>is</i> going to happen.

313
00:20:16,588 --> 00:20:20,088
Exactly. 99.78% to be exact.

314
00:20:20,171 --> 00:20:22,296
Oh, great. Okay, so it's not 100%.

315
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,255
Well, scientists never like to say 100%.

316
00:20:25,338 --> 00:20:27,796
Call it 70% and let's just move on.

317
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,546
But it's not even close to 70%.

318
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,963
You cannot go around saying to people

319
00:20:32,046 --> 00:20:34,796
that there's 100% chance
that they're gonna die.

320
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,796
You know? It's just nuts.

321
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,463
We should get some of
our scientists on this, you know.

322
00:20:40,546 --> 00:20:44,255
No offense, but you're just two people
that walked in here with...

323
00:20:44,338 --> 00:20:45,546
Dr. Oglethorpe.

324
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,171
Dr. Ov... Ogilvy. Yeah.

325
00:20:47,255 --> 00:20:50,796
I've been head of planetary defense
at NASA for 15 years.

326
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,338
And Dr. Mindy is a tenured professor
of astronomy at Michigan State,

327
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:58,380
where Miss Dibiasky
is a doctoral candidate.

328
00:20:58,463 --> 00:21:01,088
- Good.
- I'm sorry. Did you say Michigan State?

329
00:21:01,171 --> 00:21:03,755
Exactly. They have
an excellent astronomy department.

330
00:21:03,838 --> 00:21:05,255
- Yes.
- Come on, bro.

331
00:21:05,338 --> 00:21:07,630
You kidding?
You wanna see my fucking SAT scores?

332
00:21:07,713 --> 00:21:09,713
Okay, let's bottom line this.

333
00:21:09,796 --> 00:21:11,671
What is this gonna cost me?

334
00:21:11,755 --> 00:21:13,880
You know, what's the ask here?

335
00:21:13,963 --> 00:21:17,046
There are government plans in place.

336
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,546
Um, actions we can take through NASA.

337
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:22,588
Drones that can be outfitted with nukes

338
00:21:22,671 --> 00:21:27,088
to deflect and hopefully
change the orbit of this comet.

339
00:21:27,171 --> 00:21:28,921
We must act now.

340
00:21:29,005 --> 00:21:31,588
Oh, hey.
All right, all right, all right.

341
00:21:31,671 --> 00:21:34,005
- When are the midterms? Three weeks.
- Three weeks.

342
00:21:34,088 --> 00:21:36,796
So, if this breaks before then,
we lose Congress.

343
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,838
Then there's nothing we can do about it.

344
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:39,838
It'll be gridlocked.

345
00:21:39,921 --> 00:21:43,921
The timing is just... It's atrocious.

346
00:21:45,005 --> 00:21:51,130
Okay, at this very moment,
I say we sit tight and assess.

347
00:21:51,213 --> 00:21:52,463
Sit tight and assess.

348
00:21:52,546 --> 00:21:55,630
Let's get some other people
on this. Some Ivy Leaguers.

349
00:21:55,713 --> 00:21:58,463
And you and I will review the NASA plans.

350
00:21:58,546 --> 00:22:00,296
- Okay?
- I'd greatly appreciate that.

351
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,588
Am I to understand correctly that,

352
00:22:03,671 --> 00:22:07,338
after all of the information
you've received today,

353
00:22:08,046 --> 00:22:12,296
the decision you're making
is to "sit tight and assess"?

354
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,630
- I'm sorry, who is she?
- Who the fuck are you? Aren't you her son?

355
00:22:15,713 --> 00:22:18,421
I'm the fucking Chief of Staff,
Boy with the Dragon Tattoo.

356
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:19,796
So I'm doing fine.

357
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,546
We gotta get out of here.
This place is a freak show.

358
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,213
I think what Miss Dibiasky
is trying to say

359
00:22:25,296 --> 00:22:30,380
is that the idea of sitting tight
is an extremely, extremely dangerous...

360
00:22:30,463 --> 00:22:32,130
Oh, oh!

361
00:22:33,505 --> 00:22:36,755
Thank you.
One good thing happened today.

362
00:22:36,838 --> 00:22:38,921
Okay, funny story.

363
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:40,671
When I was running for president,

364
00:22:40,755 --> 00:22:43,963
I had to sneak cigarettes for
the whole first month of the campaign

365
00:22:44,046 --> 00:22:46,296
because, you know,
photographs of me smoking

366
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,338
went for, what, a hundred grand a pop?

367
00:22:49,588 --> 00:22:52,546
So, I'm always hiding, but,
you know, I just got sick of it.

368
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:56,213
And I just said, "You know what,
I'm gonna smoke whenever I want to."

369
00:22:56,296 --> 00:22:58,421
Mmm...

370
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:01,796
Guess what happened?

371
00:23:02,671 --> 00:23:06,505
- I went up three points in the polls.
- They loved that she kept it real.

372
00:23:06,588 --> 00:23:08,463
They love watching a smokeshow smoke.

373
00:23:08,546 --> 00:23:11,588
I can't think of another president
that I'd ever wanna see in <i>Playboy.</i>

374
00:23:11,671 --> 00:23:15,005
Do you know how many, uh,
"the world is ending" meetings

375
00:23:15,088 --> 00:23:16,713
that we've had over the years?

376
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:20,838
Economic collapse, loose nukes,
car exhaust killing the atmosphere.

377
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:23,671
- Rogue AI.
- Drought, famine, plague...

378
00:23:23,755 --> 00:23:24,963
- Uh...
- Everything.

379
00:23:25,046 --> 00:23:28,838
Alien invasion,
population growth, hole in the ozone...

380
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:29,921
Jason, hey.

381
00:23:30,005 --> 00:23:32,171
- Read the room for once in your life.
- Sorry, Mom.

382
00:23:32,755 --> 00:23:35,005
Point is, I have a job to do.

383
00:23:35,088 --> 00:23:37,838
You do understand
that this is an apocalyptic event.

384
00:23:37,921 --> 00:23:43,255
This is a large celestial body
heading towards our planet at speeds...

385
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,338
Dr. Mindy, I hear you.

386
00:23:46,463 --> 00:23:47,630
I hear you.

387
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:51,213
- You should be proud.
- Thank you.

388
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,671
I'm taking it very seriously.
I'm taking it straight in the heart.

389
00:23:54,755 --> 00:23:57,880
I'm so glad to hear that.
You have no idea.

390
00:23:57,963 --> 00:24:03,005
Hey, gang, obviously everything we talked
about in here, super classified, right?

391
00:24:03,088 --> 00:24:04,505
- Yeah.
- Cool.

392
00:24:04,588 --> 00:24:05,755
Thanks for dressing up.

393
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,046
You're saying
we're just gonna leak it to the press?

394
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:19,630
- Isn't that illegal?
- Hell yeah, we're going to leak it.

395
00:24:19,713 --> 00:24:22,338
In case you didn't notice,
the White House just blew us off.

396
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:24,380
My boyfriend, Phillip,
says he knows a reporter

397
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,463
from the <i>New York Herald</i>
who will talk to us.

398
00:24:26,546 --> 00:24:29,255
- Adul Grelio.
- Good. He's a heavy hitter.

399
00:24:29,338 --> 00:24:32,546
And I'll reach out to more of
the scientific community on the down-low.

400
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,421
- I just feel like this isn't what I do.
- You're just telling a story.

401
00:24:38,505 --> 00:24:39,755
Keep it simple.

402
00:24:40,463 --> 00:24:41,588
No math.

403
00:24:42,796 --> 00:24:44,171
But it's <i>all</i> math.

404
00:24:56,588 --> 00:24:59,338
<i>It all started
with a connection.</i>

405
00:24:59,421 --> 00:25:03,046
<i>A simple gesture that created so much.</i>

406
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,005
<i>So many choices.</i>

407
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,546
<i>Sometimes, it can even feel like too much.</i>

408
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,880
<i>Until now.</i>

409
00:25:10,963 --> 00:25:13,296
<i>Introducing BASH LiiF.</i>

410
00:25:14,088 --> 00:25:16,796
<i>Life, without the stress of living.</i>

411
00:25:18,588 --> 00:25:21,421
<i>Before we introduce
the founder and CEO of BASH,</i>

412
00:25:21,505 --> 00:25:23,796
<i>please remember
to avoid direct eye contact,</i>

413
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,463
<i>sudden movements,
coughing or negative facial expressions.</i>

414
00:25:27,546 --> 00:25:30,921
<i>And now, please welcome
Sir Peter Isherwell.</i>

415
00:25:34,005 --> 00:25:35,796
We love you, Peter!

416
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:48,130
We love you, Peter!

417
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,380
Hello, everyone.

418
00:25:49,463 --> 00:25:51,838
All of my life's work,

419
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:57,421
really, I see has been driven
by an inexpressible need for a friend

420
00:25:58,005 --> 00:26:00,421
who would understand and soothe me.

421
00:26:00,505 --> 00:26:05,796
And you know, now all those years of work
have come to fruition with BASH LiiF,

422
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,380
our new BASH 14.3, uh, phone

423
00:26:10,463 --> 00:26:14,755
is fully integrated
into your every feeling and desire

424
00:26:14,838 --> 00:26:17,338
without you needing
to say one single word.

425
00:26:17,421 --> 00:26:18,421
If I feel...

426
00:26:19,005 --> 00:26:20,296
- Sad.
- Afraid.

427
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,463
Or alone.

428
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:25,755
The BASH 14.3 phone,
when set to the life setting,

429
00:26:25,838 --> 00:26:28,963
instantly senses my mood
through blood pressure...

430
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:31,546
Uh, heartbeats and...

431
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:34,005
<i>Your vitals
show that you are sad.</i>

432
00:26:34,088 --> 00:26:35,838
<i>This will cheer you up, Peter.</i>

433
00:26:35,921 --> 00:26:40,588
<i>♪ You are my best friend
You are my best friend ♪</i>

434
00:26:40,671 --> 00:26:43,546
<i>♪ You make me happy... ♪</i>

435
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:46,421
Oh, that's wonderful.

436
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:48,671
That video. Um...

437
00:26:48,755 --> 00:26:52,088
It also, seriously, uh, schedules

438
00:26:52,171 --> 00:26:55,380
a therapy session
with a nearby professional,

439
00:26:55,463 --> 00:27:00,213
so we can make sure that
these sad feelings never ever ever return.

440
00:27:00,296 --> 00:27:02,963
- May I say something, Mr. Isherwell?
- No.

441
00:27:03,046 --> 00:27:07,546
And to support, uh, BASH LiiF,
uh, I wanna officially announce...

442
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:10,046
Oh, give me the phones. They're not yours.

443
00:27:12,921 --> 00:27:15,130
- Say bye.
- Bye, Mr. Isherwell.

444
00:27:15,213 --> 00:27:16,463
Bye, Peter.

445
00:27:16,546 --> 00:27:18,463
Um, I love you, Peter.

446
00:27:18,546 --> 00:27:21,338
Are you sure the video
of the puppy on the rooster

447
00:27:21,421 --> 00:27:25,421
is optimizing our prepubescent
sense memory consumer sector?

448
00:27:25,505 --> 00:27:27,171
I find the bird quite threatening.

449
00:27:27,255 --> 00:27:30,296
We will cross-check
the data on that, for sure.

450
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,963
Mr. Isherwell, Paul Debent
wanted me to give this to you.

451
00:27:33,046 --> 00:27:35,796
He got it from
an astronomer friend of his in Mexico.

452
00:27:38,171 --> 00:27:39,171
Oh, my.

453
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,005
What other confirmation
do we have on this, Adul?

454
00:27:43,088 --> 00:27:46,421
I've spoken to Dr. Oglethorpe in DC
and he confirmed it and all the math.

455
00:27:46,505 --> 00:27:48,505
Then I showed it
to Dr. Franks at Columbia,

456
00:27:48,588 --> 00:27:50,838
and he almost fell out of his chair.

457
00:27:50,921 --> 00:27:54,880
So, look, I have to admit.
I was very skeptical at first,

458
00:27:54,963 --> 00:27:56,588
but this is all quite credible.

459
00:27:56,671 --> 00:27:58,921
The calculations are credible.

460
00:27:59,421 --> 00:28:00,421
Jesus.

461
00:28:00,755 --> 00:28:02,755
And the president
really said to sit tight?

462
00:28:02,838 --> 00:28:05,588
- Yes. That's correct.
- "Sit tight and assess."

463
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:07,713
She's probably worried about the midterms.

464
00:28:07,796 --> 00:28:09,380
We need to move fast.

465
00:28:09,463 --> 00:28:11,338
The feds will claim breach of security,

466
00:28:11,421 --> 00:28:13,380
so make sure these two
get a pro bono attorney.

467
00:28:13,463 --> 00:28:16,463
- You can use my attorney.
- You can certainly afford it now.

468
00:28:16,546 --> 00:28:17,838
We're gonna hire a lawyer?

469
00:28:17,921 --> 00:28:20,171
- That wasn't necessary.
- It was.

470
00:28:20,255 --> 00:28:21,796
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.

471
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,171
That was not called for.

472
00:28:23,255 --> 00:28:25,088
I just have a question here.

473
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:27,630
How is it criminal if we just tell people,

474
00:28:27,713 --> 00:28:31,005
like the public, you know,
what we saw, and tell them the truth?

475
00:28:31,088 --> 00:28:34,171
Make sure this one gets media training
before he hits the shows.

476
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:35,880
He seems a step slow.

477
00:28:35,963 --> 00:28:38,088
What does that mean,
I need media training?

478
00:28:39,046 --> 00:28:41,796
They want us on a show
called <i>The Daily Rip</i>

479
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,505
first thing in the morning
before the article comes out.

480
00:28:44,588 --> 00:28:46,421
You guys know what <i>The Daily Rip</i> is?

481
00:28:46,505 --> 00:28:49,005
It's like the best show.
Everyone wants to be on it.

482
00:28:49,088 --> 00:28:50,921
Brie and Jack have legendary chemistry.

483
00:28:51,005 --> 00:28:52,255
They asked me to go on once.

484
00:28:52,338 --> 00:28:54,505
I was so excited
I couldn't sleep for two nights,

485
00:28:54,588 --> 00:28:55,921
but then they cut me for time.

486
00:28:56,005 --> 00:28:57,755
Still hurts me to think about that.

487
00:28:57,838 --> 00:29:01,588
I know what show you're talking about.
My wife loves that show.

488
00:29:01,671 --> 00:29:04,463
Okay, can you just tell me
what this is all about? Okay?

489
00:29:04,546 --> 00:29:07,921
'Cause you haven't read my article
on Conlon getting hard in the art class.

490
00:29:08,005 --> 00:29:10,796
Now Adul Grelio has come down
from his mountaintop for your thing.

491
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,630
You won't even give me
a lousy pronoun? Come on.

492
00:29:13,713 --> 00:29:16,713
A comet, bigger than the asteroid
that destroyed the dinosaurs,

493
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,171
is headed directly at Earth.

494
00:29:18,255 --> 00:29:20,546
If it isn't deflected,
the entire planet dies.

495
00:29:21,088 --> 00:29:22,630
Wait, what did you just say?

496
00:29:22,713 --> 00:29:24,005
It's for a video game.

497
00:29:27,463 --> 00:29:28,796
Are you being serious?

498
00:29:29,546 --> 00:29:30,546
Yes.

499
00:29:32,796 --> 00:29:34,088
Oh, my God.

500
00:29:44,338 --> 00:29:47,046
Oh, my God! What the fuck, man?

501
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,921
I love you too. All right. Yeah.

502
00:29:50,546 --> 00:29:52,963
Hey, guys,
we gotta keep walking, all right?

503
00:29:53,046 --> 00:29:54,213
Come on.

504
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:33,463
- You must be Dr. Mindy and Miss Dibiasky?
- Yes.

505
00:30:33,546 --> 00:30:35,838
Jack and Brie are so excited
to have you on the show.

506
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:37,755
Really? They know who we are?

507
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:40,171
White House is denying
they even met with them.

508
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:43,796
Well, assholes will always be assholes.

509
00:30:52,755 --> 00:30:54,630
Hi, I'm Thalia.

510
00:30:54,713 --> 00:30:57,005
The <i>Herald</i> sent me
to help with your wardrobe.

511
00:30:58,421 --> 00:30:59,838
Oh, I'm not wearing that.

512
00:31:01,588 --> 00:31:05,421
Yeah, you actually have
really great facial structure.

513
00:31:05,505 --> 00:31:08,338
How 'bout if we trim
this beard down a little bit and...

514
00:31:08,421 --> 00:31:09,838
I love your hair.

515
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,630
Thank you.

516
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,963
How are we gonna do this?
I talk about the discovery and you...

517
00:31:16,671 --> 00:31:19,088
talk about how urgent it is
that we take action.

518
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:21,421
How do we say it? I mean...

519
00:31:22,713 --> 00:31:26,130
- Shouldn't we practice it or write it out?
- Can I get you some water?

520
00:31:26,213 --> 00:31:28,463
Yeah, water. Yeah, water would be nice.

521
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:32,421
You are here now.
You are here now. You are here now.

522
00:31:32,505 --> 00:31:37,380
Eleven benevolent elephants.
Eleven benevolent elephants.

523
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,046
- Just gonna take some Xanax.
- Hmm.

524
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:42,838
I take it sometimes when I...

525
00:31:44,463 --> 00:31:46,630
Kate, not this time. Not this time.

526
00:31:51,421 --> 00:31:56,296
He just needs to breathe
and speak up. You know?

527
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,880
He's got this. I know he does.

528
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:04,463
Oh, God. Come on.

529
00:32:09,046 --> 00:32:12,213
You are here now.
You are here now. You are here now.

530
00:32:12,296 --> 00:32:13,338
You're here now.

531
00:32:17,546 --> 00:32:18,463
Oh, God!

532
00:32:18,546 --> 00:32:20,380
You gotta
stop drinking the cheap shit.

533
00:32:21,755 --> 00:32:23,755
- It's only two glasses.
- Yeah, two and a half.

534
00:32:23,838 --> 00:32:25,558
- We're 20 out.
- Always running late.

535
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,546
Let's make sure that our eye lines,

536
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:30,255
that we're not looking
at Jack and Brie, please, all right?

537
00:32:30,338 --> 00:32:31,713
And cue the package.

538
00:32:31,796 --> 00:32:33,338
Two glasses. Here we go again.

539
00:32:52,046 --> 00:32:54,713
- Ladies okay?
- Yes. And we're live.

540
00:32:54,796 --> 00:32:58,088
<i>Brie, I've got something for you today.
Listen to this.</i>

541
00:32:58,171 --> 00:33:01,046
<i>President Orlean's Supreme Court nominee,
Sheriff Conlon,</i>

542
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:06,213
<i>has now been identified
as appearing in a softcore porn cable show</i>

543
00:33:06,296 --> 00:33:07,796
<i>- from the early '90s...</i>
- Ridiculous.

544
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,838
<i>...called</i> Satin Sheet Nights.

545
00:33:10,921 --> 00:33:13,755
<i>- This story just keeps going and going...</i>
<i>- Oh, my gosh.</i>

546
00:33:13,838 --> 00:33:15,130
Is that Riley Bina?

547
00:33:15,213 --> 00:33:17,171
- <i>Yes, well, it's a...</i>
- Really?

548
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,213
She looks a lot smaller
in person, doesn't she?

549
00:33:22,796 --> 00:33:24,755
<i>Ride 'em, cowboy.</i>

550
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:27,338
- <i>Good.</i>
<i>- Hee-haw!</i>

551
00:33:27,421 --> 00:33:30,088
Hey, everyone. I'm Sean from the show.

552
00:33:30,171 --> 00:33:33,880
Uh, we're gonna do... Jack and Brie
are gonna do ten on the SCOTUS nominee.

553
00:33:33,963 --> 00:33:37,255
- Riley Bina, you'll come on and...
- I get to talk about my single, right?

554
00:33:37,338 --> 00:33:40,296
A portion of the profits
goes to the manatee sanctuaries.

555
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,380
Yes, but the, uh, breakup first.

556
00:33:42,463 --> 00:33:45,088
And then Dr. Mindy and Miss Dibiasky,

557
00:33:45,171 --> 00:33:47,588
you'll come on and talk about
that planet you discovered.

558
00:33:47,671 --> 00:33:49,463
Uh... Comet. We found a comet.

559
00:33:49,546 --> 00:33:51,671
They know what we're here
to talk about, right?

560
00:33:51,755 --> 00:33:54,463
Of course. Jack and Brie
love doing science segments.

561
00:33:54,546 --> 00:33:56,380
Just remember, keep it light, fun.

562
00:33:56,463 --> 00:33:58,880
Jack and Brie love having a good time.

563
00:33:58,963 --> 00:34:00,505
That's not promising.

564
00:34:00,588 --> 00:34:03,713
You guys discovered a comet?
That's so dope.

565
00:34:03,796 --> 00:34:05,921
I have a tattoo
of a shooting star on my back.

566
00:34:06,005 --> 00:34:07,838
- Oh.
- That's terrific.

567
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:17,755
We heard about your breakup too,
so we just wanna say...

568
00:34:18,713 --> 00:34:20,338
We're very sorry, right?

569
00:34:20,421 --> 00:34:23,296
We're real sorry.
You seem like a... great person.

570
00:34:24,088 --> 00:34:26,588
Why don't you mind
your own business, you old fuck?

571
00:34:29,505 --> 00:34:30,505
Okay.

572
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,296
Not gonna lie, but, um, my friends

573
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:38,755
and my Vroom Vroom Army
have been so amazing.

574
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:42,505
So, I'm really grateful for that.
But, yeah, I can't lie. It's been hard.

575
00:34:42,588 --> 00:34:45,296
- You're an inspiration. It's incredible.
- To so many.

576
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,255
You're really owning that pain.

577
00:34:47,338 --> 00:34:51,046
You know, Jack, I feel like
there's some kind of conversation

578
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:54,505
that we need to be having here.
Is there any message

579
00:34:54,588 --> 00:34:58,755
that you would like
to send to your, uh, ex, DJ Chello?

580
00:34:59,796 --> 00:35:01,088
You know, um...

581
00:35:01,171 --> 00:35:02,630
If there's something...

582
00:35:02,713 --> 00:35:04,296
- Yeah.
- Right here in this camera.

583
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,671
Tell him. As if that was him.
You tell him exactly what you're thinking.

584
00:35:07,755 --> 00:35:09,213
Okay, um...

585
00:35:11,588 --> 00:35:12,671
Chell.

586
00:35:13,505 --> 00:35:19,255
I still love you,
and, um, after many sleepless nights,

587
00:35:20,755 --> 00:35:21,838
three,

588
00:35:22,546 --> 00:35:23,880
I wanna take you back.

589
00:35:23,963 --> 00:35:25,713
I'm sorry. Whoa, uh...

590
00:35:25,796 --> 00:35:26,880
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

591
00:35:26,963 --> 00:35:29,880
- <i>He cheated on you.</i>
- Oh, my God. You guys...

592
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:31,671
Yeah. I do.

593
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,005
- Diddly just exploded.
- So did Vroom Vroom.

594
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:36,255
BASH News just sent me
eight push notifications.

595
00:35:36,338 --> 00:35:38,171
- About this?
- Yeah, look.

596
00:35:38,255 --> 00:35:40,713
My phone just purchased
DJ Chello's latest single.

597
00:35:40,796 --> 00:35:42,880
What the... It just did
that without asking.

598
00:35:42,963 --> 00:35:45,796
I'm being told that
we have DJ Chello live on a Mugg link.

599
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,796
- What's he got to say for himself?
- I love the producers here.

600
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,130
<i>Hey, baby doll. Hey.</i>

601
00:35:50,213 --> 00:35:52,093
- Hi. Hi, baby.
- He's in tears.

602
00:35:52,171 --> 00:35:54,088
<i>- Your kid messed up bad.</i>
- I know.

603
00:35:54,171 --> 00:35:56,671
<i>Lady Baroque wasn't wearing
any panties in the club that night.</i>

604
00:35:56,755 --> 00:35:58,421
- It's fine.
<i>- I just got all crazy.</i>

605
00:35:58,505 --> 00:36:00,421
<i>I wasn't thinking straight.
I made a mistake.</i>

606
00:36:00,505 --> 00:36:02,380
<i>But, look, it's always been you.</i>

607
00:36:02,463 --> 00:36:04,796
Oh! I get it. It's okay.

608
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,588
<i>I hooked up with her too,
last year at the Music Globes</i>

609
00:36:07,671 --> 00:36:10,064
<i>right before I ran off
with that power forward from the Nuggets,</i>

610
00:36:10,088 --> 00:36:12,255
and none of that matters.

611
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:15,921
What about "Forget breakup sex.
Try breakup relationship"?

612
00:36:16,005 --> 00:36:17,171
- That's good.
- Come on.

613
00:36:17,255 --> 00:36:20,171
"Ten famous second chances
for two-timers," guys.

614
00:36:20,255 --> 00:36:21,171
It's on a plate.

615
00:36:21,255 --> 00:36:25,130
<i>I've been scared, but, honestly,
I'm not scared anymore.</i>

616
00:36:25,213 --> 00:36:26,046
Okay.

617
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,963
<i>My little bumblebee, will you marry me?</i>

618
00:36:29,046 --> 00:36:31,630
- Oh, my God. Of course.
- Oh, wow.

619
00:36:31,713 --> 00:36:33,213
<i>- Chell, of course.</i>
<i>- Yes!</i>

620
00:36:33,296 --> 00:36:35,421
<i>- Yes!</i>
- That's sick.

621
00:36:35,505 --> 00:36:36,338
<i>Yes!</i>

622
00:36:36,421 --> 00:36:38,796
All right, DJ Chello.

623
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,880
What is happening?

624
00:36:40,963 --> 00:36:41,963
Just bought another.

625
00:36:42,005 --> 00:36:44,921
- Who are these people again?
- They're like the biggest names...

626
00:36:46,588 --> 00:36:49,630
Well, the fireworks
have certainly gone off today.

627
00:36:49,713 --> 00:36:50,880
- They have.
- What a zinger!

628
00:36:50,963 --> 00:36:52,463
Yes, they have.

629
00:36:52,546 --> 00:36:55,255
From a wedding proposal
to a little science experiment.

630
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,255
I'll need a temple rub
and a martini later on.

631
00:36:57,338 --> 00:37:02,046
Our last guests today have made
a pretty big discovery in space.

632
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,046
Astronomer Dr. Randall Mindy

633
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:07,213
and PhD candidate
Miss Kate Dibiasky are here.

634
00:37:07,296 --> 00:37:08,338
Welcome to the show.

635
00:37:08,421 --> 00:37:11,588
Can I ask you one thing before we go
any further? I have to know this.

636
00:37:11,671 --> 00:37:14,213
Is there life out there?

637
00:37:14,296 --> 00:37:17,713
- Can you tell us? Yes or no, final answer.
- We don't have the data.

638
00:37:17,796 --> 00:37:19,963
But sure, in the vastness
of space, why not?

639
00:37:20,046 --> 00:37:21,546
Yes, aliens are real.

640
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,171
I knew I'd like this guy.
Didn't I tell? You owe me 50 bucks.

641
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:27,005
I'm not saying there's
little green men in flying saucers...

642
00:37:27,088 --> 00:37:30,213
- Please don't encourage him, Dr. Mindy.
- That's what he's saying.

643
00:37:30,296 --> 00:37:31,713
We'll never get out of here.

644
00:37:31,796 --> 00:37:33,546
Now, Jack was having some fun here.

645
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:35,171
- Dad looks great.
- What did...

646
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:37,615
- Doesn't he look good?
- They did something with his beard.

647
00:37:37,671 --> 00:37:39,588
With the aliens...

648
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:41,463
Really... He really does.

649
00:37:41,546 --> 00:37:43,630
- So much.
- Dr. Randall...

650
00:37:43,713 --> 00:37:47,130
You'll regret it. Now, look,
Jack's just having some fun here

651
00:37:47,213 --> 00:37:48,880
with the aliens or whatever,

652
00:37:48,963 --> 00:37:53,255
but there's a <i>New York Herald</i> story
that's just come out that talks about...

653
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:55,380
Keep it right there. You're doing good.

654
00:37:55,463 --> 00:37:57,838
- ...the two of you have made.
- That's right, Brie.

655
00:37:57,921 --> 00:38:00,963
Kate was, um, observing supernovas...

656
00:38:01,046 --> 00:38:02,588
Yo, that's your girl?

657
00:38:02,671 --> 00:38:05,088
- Yeah.
- Not bad.

658
00:38:05,171 --> 00:38:09,630
...an absolutely shocking
and once-in-a-lifetime discovery.

659
00:38:09,713 --> 00:38:13,005
I had no idea that Subaru made telescopes.

660
00:38:13,088 --> 00:38:16,171
This has to be exciting.
Tell us what you found, Miss Diabasky.

661
00:38:16,255 --> 00:38:20,255
Um, I was monitoring exploding stars

662
00:38:20,338 --> 00:38:26,755
to help measure
the expansion of the universe and...

663
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:28,880
- For your PhD, right?
- Yeah.

664
00:38:28,963 --> 00:38:33,130
I saw something I didn't recognize.

665
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:36,046
<i>It was a comet.</i>

666
00:38:37,046 --> 00:38:38,171
<i>A big one.</i>

667
00:38:40,713 --> 00:38:44,588
It's headed directly at Earth,
and it really likely will hit.

668
00:38:45,921 --> 00:38:47,796
This sounds very, very exciting.

669
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,463
Exploding stars, like,
stars actually explode.

670
00:38:50,546 --> 00:38:51,713
Um, how big is this thing?

671
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:54,088
Can it destroy someone's house?
Is that possible?

672
00:38:54,171 --> 00:38:57,338
Well, Comet Dibiasky, which is
what it will officially be named...

673
00:38:57,421 --> 00:38:58,897
- After her?
- Yeah, after her.

674
00:38:58,921 --> 00:39:01,588
- Congratulations.
- What an honor. Congratulations.

675
00:39:01,671 --> 00:39:04,171
It's somewhere between
six and nine kilometers across.

676
00:39:04,255 --> 00:39:05,588
- So...
- It's big.

677
00:39:05,671 --> 00:39:08,880
It would damage the entire planet.

678
00:39:08,963 --> 00:39:10,588
Not just a house, you know?

679
00:39:10,671 --> 00:39:11,713
The entire planet.

680
00:39:11,796 --> 00:39:14,713
Okay, as it's damaging,
will it hit this one house in particular

681
00:39:14,796 --> 00:39:17,880
that's right on the coast of New Jersey?
It's my ex-wife's house.

682
00:39:17,963 --> 00:39:19,213
Can we make that happen?

683
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,713
You and Shelly have
a great relationship. Stop.

684
00:39:21,796 --> 00:39:23,130
You need to stop.

685
00:39:23,213 --> 00:39:26,130
I will, but in all fairness,
I actually paid for the house.

686
00:39:26,213 --> 00:39:27,505
I'm so sorry.

687
00:39:27,588 --> 00:39:30,588
I'm sorry, are we not being clear?

688
00:39:31,921 --> 00:39:33,796
We're trying to tell you

689
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,296
that the entire planet
is about to be destroyed.

690
00:39:37,963 --> 00:39:40,296
- Okay, um...
- Well, it's, you know...

691
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:43,630
It's something we do around here.
We just keep the bad news light.

692
00:39:43,713 --> 00:39:45,630
Right. It helps the medicine go down.

693
00:39:45,713 --> 00:39:47,671
Speaking of medicine, tomorrow we've got...

694
00:39:47,755 --> 00:39:51,546
Well, maybe the destruction
of the entire planet

695
00:39:52,463 --> 00:39:53,838
isn't supposed to be fun.

696
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:58,255
Maybe it's supposed to be terrifying.

697
00:39:58,338 --> 00:39:59,338
<i>And unsettling.</i>

698
00:39:59,421 --> 00:40:01,130
No, please don't do that.

699
00:40:01,213 --> 00:40:03,338
<i>- And you should stay up all night...</i>
- Please.

700
00:40:03,421 --> 00:40:05,255
...every night crying,

701
00:40:05,338 --> 00:40:09,755
when we're all 100%
for sure gonna fucking die!

702
00:40:10,505 --> 00:40:12,421
Hey, Kate.

703
00:40:12,505 --> 00:40:13,505
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

704
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,880
Hey, man.

705
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,713
My brother has bipolar disorder.
So if you ever need anyone to talk...

706
00:40:20,713 --> 00:40:22,588
- Uh...
- Okay.

707
00:40:22,671 --> 00:40:25,588
Is she always like that?

708
00:40:26,296 --> 00:40:28,088
- I...
- Something I said?

709
00:40:28,171 --> 00:40:30,088
Right?

710
00:40:30,171 --> 00:40:33,630
Maybe I should have given her
that extra Xanax that I had.

711
00:40:34,796 --> 00:40:38,213
Listen, if you don't have enough,
we all have enough around here for her.

712
00:40:38,296 --> 00:40:41,171
A spoonful of Xanax
makes the medicine go down, right?

713
00:40:41,255 --> 00:40:42,921
That's right. That's good.

714
00:40:43,921 --> 00:40:47,171
- We're gonna have to get you back.
- I knew I'd like this guy.

715
00:40:47,255 --> 00:40:49,338
- Is he a plant?
- I knew it.

716
00:40:49,421 --> 00:40:50,338
Okay.

717
00:40:50,421 --> 00:40:52,796
Well, the handsome astronomer

718
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,380
can come back anytime,
but the yelling lady, not so much.

719
00:40:56,463 --> 00:40:59,421
Not so much. Join us tomorrow
when our guest will be the man

720
00:40:59,505 --> 00:41:03,088
that many say will challenge
President Orlean in two years.

721
00:41:03,171 --> 00:41:05,171
Senator Jeff Lerner will be here.

722
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:08,005
And wrongly-convicted murderer,
Michelle Weems,

723
00:41:08,088 --> 00:41:12,380
talks to us about her controversial
third-place finish on <i>Celebrity Dance Off.</i>

724
00:41:12,463 --> 00:41:15,838
- I thought she would've won.
- Yes. I still think she's guilty.

725
00:41:15,921 --> 00:41:18,121
- That's <i>The Daily Rip,</i> guys.
- Have a great day.

726
00:41:18,671 --> 00:41:20,588
- And we're out!
- The show's over?

727
00:41:20,671 --> 00:41:21,991
- I mean, didn't...
- Yeah.

728
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:24,505
- Did what we wanted to say come across?
- No, it's over.

729
00:41:24,588 --> 00:41:28,505
You were great, but I think mullet girl,
she probably needs some media training.

730
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,296
- Really?
- Yeah, no, terrible, buddy.

731
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,921
Oh... Thanks. Thanks, Billy.

732
00:41:34,005 --> 00:41:39,505
Uh, we usually get drinks at Aundrine's
after our five o'clock staff meeting.

733
00:41:39,588 --> 00:41:42,046
You know, it's fun. You should come.

734
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:45,046
Oh, I'll have to see.
Thank you for the invitation. Thank you.

735
00:41:45,588 --> 00:41:46,588
Mmm-hmm.

736
00:41:47,921 --> 00:41:49,296
Kate? Kate?

737
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,255
- Hey. You were awesome.
- Oh, thanks.

738
00:41:52,338 --> 00:41:54,296
Can I get a photo of you for my portfolio?

739
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,671
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

740
00:41:55,755 --> 00:41:57,088
Thank you.

741
00:41:57,671 --> 00:41:59,171
You can see this spike here

742
00:41:59,255 --> 00:42:01,380
is when Riley Bina
asked to take DJ Chello back

743
00:42:01,463 --> 00:42:02,755
on the segment before you.

744
00:42:02,838 --> 00:42:06,046
We saw engagement across
all social media platforms.

745
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:08,921
Hmm. And what about our story?

746
00:42:09,005 --> 00:42:11,963
Randall and Kate,

747
00:42:12,046 --> 00:42:15,755
your TV appearance got some nice traffic
when Miss Dibiasky cursed.

748
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:19,046
But, unfortunately,
there was an immediate backlash

749
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:20,850
that quickly became a meme.

750
00:42:20,921 --> 00:42:22,213
Oh, Jesus.

751
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,255
- Oh, that's terrible.
- They just think I'm crazy.

752
00:42:26,338 --> 00:42:29,338
I mean, look at that.
That's so unnecessary.

753
00:42:30,713 --> 00:42:33,130
- You can move on, Erin.
- Yeah.

754
00:42:33,213 --> 00:42:35,921
That is just so...
Is that even allowed on the Internet or...

755
00:42:36,005 --> 00:42:37,630
I think that's Photoshop, Kate.

756
00:42:37,713 --> 00:42:40,088
The trick is
to not take it personal...

757
00:42:40,171 --> 00:42:44,463
Dr. Mindy, on the other hand,
had some very high favorables.

758
00:42:44,546 --> 00:42:49,130
Vegan♪Babe wrote,
"Meow! Me likey hunky Star Man."

759
00:42:49,213 --> 00:42:52,213
Uh, some accounts called him
"The Bedroom Eyes Doomsday Prophet"

760
00:42:52,296 --> 00:42:55,088
or A-I-L-F, which means
"astronomer I'd like to fuck."

761
00:42:55,171 --> 00:42:56,046
Oh...

762
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:58,671
I don't see what that has
to do with anything, do you?

763
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,505
And that's everything.

764
00:43:02,588 --> 00:43:05,671
We did not feature or push on any sites,

765
00:43:05,755 --> 00:43:09,088
and clicks overall were below
basic weather and traffic stories.

766
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:12,505
So that... That... That's it?

767
00:43:12,588 --> 00:43:14,338
- I knew it.
- That's it.

768
00:43:15,255 --> 00:43:17,838
- Thank you, Erin.
- Yeah, no problem.

769
00:43:18,505 --> 00:43:20,755
I don't... I don't understand.

770
00:43:20,838 --> 00:43:22,671
I don't understand. There's no response.

771
00:43:22,755 --> 00:43:27,380
There's absolutely no...
Why aren't people terrified?

772
00:43:27,463 --> 00:43:29,463
What do we have to say?
What do we have to do?

773
00:43:29,546 --> 00:43:32,921
There are scientists in Mexico and Spain
who are currently going through the data,

774
00:43:33,005 --> 00:43:34,713
and, uh, South Korea has expressed...

775
00:43:34,796 --> 00:43:36,505
- That's great. South Korea.
- Hey.

776
00:43:36,588 --> 00:43:39,046
Let us not bullshit each other.

777
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:42,796
The bottom line is,
you guys told us the science was 100%.

778
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,630
It's not. Now we look like idiots.

779
00:43:44,713 --> 00:43:47,296
- No. Who said the science is not 100%?
- Excuse me?

780
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:50,255
I wanna talk to this person.
You tell me who said the science...

781
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:53,338
Dr. Jocelyn Calder, the head of NASA,

782
00:43:53,421 --> 00:43:56,630
just came out calling it
"more near-miss hysteria."

783
00:43:56,713 --> 00:43:58,630
She's the one
who told us not to say anything.

784
00:43:58,713 --> 00:44:00,088
"More near-miss hysteria."

785
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:01,296
Is she even an astronomer?

786
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,463
She's the head of NASA, but maybe
she doesn't know what she's talking about.

787
00:44:04,546 --> 00:44:05,963
She's the head of NASA, but look,

788
00:44:06,046 --> 00:44:09,880
she's a "former anesthesiologist
and a President Orlean super donor."

789
00:44:09,963 --> 00:44:11,588
Let's not be dramatic here.

790
00:44:11,671 --> 00:44:12,671
It's all corrupt.

791
00:44:12,755 --> 00:44:16,421
Yes, but the point is that Adul's right.
There's still serious debate.

792
00:44:16,505 --> 00:44:18,713
And now the <i>Herald</i> has egg on its face.

793
00:44:18,796 --> 00:44:20,921
We've taken that story as far as it goes.

794
00:44:21,671 --> 00:44:25,630
Ladies, gentlemen,
I wish you a very pleasant end of times.

795
00:44:25,713 --> 00:44:27,713
It's not a goddamn story, okay?

796
00:44:30,213 --> 00:44:32,921
We have precisely six months, ten days,

797
00:44:33,005 --> 00:44:36,255
two hours, 11 minutes and 41 seconds,

798
00:44:36,338 --> 00:44:39,005
until a comet twice the size of Chicxulub

799
00:44:39,088 --> 00:44:41,838
tears through our atmosphere
and extincts all life on Earth.

800
00:44:41,921 --> 00:44:44,838
When did you
do those calculations?

801
00:44:45,671 --> 00:44:48,255
I put the moment of impact on a diet app.

802
00:44:48,338 --> 00:44:51,963
So, impact is when my diet ends.

803
00:44:52,046 --> 00:44:56,130
Only I'm not on a diet.
I'm just crying five times a day.

804
00:44:56,213 --> 00:44:58,130
- I'm scared.
- Hey, come on. Come on.

805
00:44:58,838 --> 00:45:01,421
Everyone should be
panicking right now, okay?

806
00:45:01,505 --> 00:45:03,421
- Don't cry. Come on.
- I know.

807
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:08,296
That prick!

808
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,671
What happened?

809
00:45:17,755 --> 00:45:20,088
Guess my boyfriend just broke up with me.

810
00:45:20,171 --> 00:45:24,505
God, what a day. What a day...

811
00:45:32,671 --> 00:45:35,963
You're gonna die!
You're gonna die! You're...

812
00:45:46,296 --> 00:45:49,713
<i>It started with
a photo many thought was an armpit</i>

813
00:45:49,796 --> 00:45:52,463
<i>or the chin of a man with a strange beard.</i>

814
00:45:52,546 --> 00:45:54,838
<i>But what's emerging now is a scandal...</i>

815
00:45:54,921 --> 00:45:57,838
<i>President Orlean sent
her Supreme Court nominee</i>

816
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:00,588
<i>a cell phone picture of her private parts.</i>

817
00:46:00,671 --> 00:46:02,713
<i>- Holy crap!</i>
<i>- It's clickbait material.</i>

818
00:46:02,796 --> 00:46:05,255
<i>Is this what you want
in your country as a leader?</i>

819
00:46:05,338 --> 00:46:07,713
<i>Isn't she the same person
who told poor people</i>

820
00:46:07,796 --> 00:46:11,838
<i>that if they don't wanna be poor,
they should pick better lottery numbers?</i>

821
00:46:11,921 --> 00:46:12,963
<i>She actually said that.</i>

822
00:46:13,046 --> 00:46:14,546
<i>A source also confirmed to me that</i>

823
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:16,755
<i>the two have been
having an affair for years.</i>

824
00:46:16,838 --> 00:46:18,421
<i>And as recently as yesterday...</i>

825
00:46:18,505 --> 00:46:22,588
Members of my party
are currently drawing up a formal censure

826
00:46:22,671 --> 00:46:23,671
<i>of the president,</i>

827
00:46:24,588 --> 00:46:25,505
<i>Janie Orlean...</i>

828
00:46:25,588 --> 00:46:26,921
Oh, my God, honey.

829
00:46:27,005 --> 00:46:29,796
This guy doesn't even know
what a heliocentric orbit is,

830
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,630
and he's calling me a crackpot.

831
00:46:32,713 --> 00:46:33,713
He says that,

832
00:46:34,546 --> 00:46:38,171
"Jewish billionaires
invented this comet threat

833
00:46:38,255 --> 00:46:42,130
so the government
can confiscate our liberty and our guns."

834
00:46:42,213 --> 00:46:45,505
"#DontBeScared." Unbelievable.

835
00:46:46,213 --> 00:46:47,046
My God.

836
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:49,046
You've been on that site a lot lately.

837
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:54,838
Yeah. I mean, I... I have, like,
a quarter million subscribers, honey.

838
00:46:54,921 --> 00:46:57,880
I gotta use my voice
to get the truth out there, right?

839
00:46:58,838 --> 00:47:01,921
I'm, uh, going for a walk
if you wanna come.

840
00:47:05,213 --> 00:47:07,755
It is called
the scientific method...

841
00:47:08,755 --> 00:47:11,671
...and it is what created the computer

842
00:47:11,755 --> 00:47:16,671
that you are typing
your half-witted conspiracy theories on.

843
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:19,713
What do you think about that?

844
00:47:20,755 --> 00:47:21,963
Randall?

845
00:47:22,755 --> 00:47:25,255
- Yeah, honey?
- Someone's here to see you.

846
00:47:25,921 --> 00:47:28,088
Who? Oh, boy.

847
00:47:31,421 --> 00:47:32,505
Oh, my gosh.

848
00:47:33,546 --> 00:47:35,463
Oh, God, right. Okay.

849
00:47:36,546 --> 00:47:37,546
Right.

850
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,171
Are you Dr. Randall Mindy?

851
00:47:39,255 --> 00:47:40,421
<i>Yes, sir. I am.</i>

852
00:47:41,796 --> 00:47:43,838
"We're all gonna die."

853
00:47:43,921 --> 00:47:45,713
Fuck off, please.

854
00:47:48,755 --> 00:47:51,963
FBI! Freeze! Get on your knees right now!
Get on your knees!

855
00:47:52,713 --> 00:47:55,505
You're under arrest
for breach of national security secrets.

856
00:47:55,588 --> 00:47:56,463
Jesus Christ!

857
00:47:56,546 --> 00:48:00,130
You could've just called me
or showed up to my apartment.

858
00:48:01,213 --> 00:48:03,213
What are you, dressed up as a blind guy?

859
00:48:05,671 --> 00:48:08,588
- Get on the ground!
- Okay. Now be cool.

860
00:48:09,546 --> 00:48:12,088
I just have
more skin pigmentation than you.

861
00:48:12,171 --> 00:48:15,088
'Cause your ancestors
migrated to Northern Europe

862
00:48:15,171 --> 00:48:17,255
and developed lighter skin
so as to not get...

863
00:48:19,505 --> 00:48:22,963
Unless you assholes
are taking me to the Batcave,

864
00:48:23,046 --> 00:48:24,796
fuck you for putting this hood on me.

865
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:29,546
Watch out for him.
He'll charge you for free shit.

866
00:48:30,213 --> 00:48:32,588
What's he doing here?
Is he here for us?

867
00:48:33,255 --> 00:48:34,630
Gentlemen, you can come in.

868
00:48:39,213 --> 00:48:41,546
I think
it was Winston Churchill who...

869
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:47,505
Or maybe it was Bobby Knight
who said, "The great labor of leadership"

870
00:48:47,588 --> 00:48:51,088
is to lay down one's yoke of pride

871
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:54,796
"and admit that mistakes were made."

872
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,046
You were deceived,
as was I, but the end result was,

873
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:01,796
we had our scientists who went to,
uh, the prestigious schools of Harvard,

874
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:03,005
Princeton, et cetera.

875
00:49:03,505 --> 00:49:08,421
They confirmed the data.
So we would like to offer you a...

876
00:49:09,921 --> 00:49:12,005
presidential apology.

877
00:49:12,088 --> 00:49:13,088
Really?

878
00:49:13,755 --> 00:49:16,630
And we are fully prepared to mobilize

879
00:49:16,713 --> 00:49:19,588
in historic fashion
in order to save this planet.

880
00:49:21,671 --> 00:49:23,880
The best news
we've heard in a long time.

881
00:49:23,963 --> 00:49:27,546
So, basically, what you're saying is

882
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:31,463
you're about to lose the midterms
'cause you got caught

883
00:49:31,546 --> 00:49:35,630
sending pictures of your cooch
to your porn-star sheriff boyfriend.

884
00:49:35,713 --> 00:49:39,630
So now it's to your advantage
to act on the comet?

885
00:49:41,546 --> 00:49:42,713
Right.

886
00:49:42,796 --> 00:49:44,046
Okay.

887
00:49:44,671 --> 00:49:46,005
Okay. I'm just...

888
00:49:47,796 --> 00:49:51,046
God, I'm so relieved
that you guys are doing something.

889
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:54,713
- Hey, come on. Hey.
- This has been really...

890
00:49:54,796 --> 00:49:56,963
- Really, really hard.
- Come here.

891
00:49:57,046 --> 00:50:00,171
This has been really, really,
really stressful on all of us.

892
00:50:00,255 --> 00:50:01,296
Yes, I will agree.

893
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,588
This will take some
heavy weight off all of us...

894
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:06,588
Sorry, you just look
so bad when you cry.

895
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:08,463
Maybe, possibly.

896
00:50:08,546 --> 00:50:10,463
People are gonna ask
why we didn't act earlier.

897
00:50:10,546 --> 00:50:12,963
So you're gonna have
to take the hit on this one.

898
00:50:13,046 --> 00:50:16,088
Yeah, but we'll take care
of you down the road, Jocelyn.

899
00:50:16,755 --> 00:50:18,380
- We will.
- Of course, Janie.

900
00:50:19,005 --> 00:50:21,505
I will resign in disgrace
first thing tomorrow.

901
00:50:21,588 --> 00:50:24,296
- Good. Yeah, good.
- That's weird as hell.

902
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,463
She's an anesthesiologist.

903
00:50:26,546 --> 00:50:29,546
I'm going to make a statement,

904
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:32,171
presidential statement
to the American people.

905
00:50:32,255 --> 00:50:35,046
And we're not gonna tell
the press about it ahead of time

906
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:37,921
because that way
it will have the appearance

907
00:50:38,005 --> 00:50:39,671
of a breaking emergency sort of...

908
00:50:39,755 --> 00:50:42,171
<i>Good things
come to those who wait.</i>

909
00:50:42,255 --> 00:50:44,171
<i>See?</i>

910
00:50:44,255 --> 00:50:45,380
<i>Whoo!</i>

911
00:50:45,463 --> 00:50:47,130
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

912
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:53,171
<i>We interrupt this broadcast
of</i> Jackpot Fiancé

913
00:50:53,255 --> 00:50:56,505
<i>for an emergency message
from the president of the United States.</i>

914
00:50:59,921 --> 00:51:02,880
<i>Citizens of the United States
and peoples of the world,</i>

915
00:51:03,463 --> 00:51:04,796
<i>I have just been handed</i>

916
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,005
scientific findings that
confirm a worst-case scenario.

917
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:14,838
An unprecedented comet,
nine kilometers wide,

918
00:51:14,921 --> 00:51:21,338
is now on a direct collision course
with our cherished home, planet Earth.

919
00:51:21,421 --> 00:51:24,671
<i>Estimated time of arrival
is approximately five months from now.</i>

920
00:51:24,755 --> 00:51:25,671
<i>So we have...</i>

921
00:51:25,755 --> 00:51:27,963
We've drawn up a massive
Congressional spending bill...

922
00:51:28,046 --> 00:51:31,796
I have already put together an emergency
spending package for Congress...

923
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,147
...that the Senate
and the House have agreed upon.

924
00:51:34,171 --> 00:51:35,005
That's good to hear.

925
00:51:35,088 --> 00:51:39,171
<i>And that will enable NASA
and our great military</i>

926
00:51:39,255 --> 00:51:41,088
<i>to launch a preemptive strike,</i>

927
00:51:42,546 --> 00:51:46,255
using decommissioned
space shuttles and satellites

928
00:51:46,338 --> 00:51:49,046
loaded with nuclear explosives.

929
00:51:49,130 --> 00:51:53,338
We will blow Comet Dibiasky
off her course...

930
00:51:53,421 --> 00:51:55,463
But we're gonna need a hero.

931
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:58,796
We're gonna need a pilot, real guns and...

932
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,255
Shouldn't this mission be accomplished
using remote technology?

933
00:52:02,338 --> 00:52:04,546
Washington's always gotta have a hero.

934
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:06,005
I have asked.

935
00:52:07,005 --> 00:52:13,005
Medal of Freedom recipient
and outspoken patriot, Benedict Drask,

936
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:16,255
<i>to undertake this difficult and...</i>

937
00:52:16,338 --> 00:52:18,963
I'm sorry.
Isn't he the mercenary gentleman

938
00:52:19,046 --> 00:52:22,421
that was screaming at all those children
on the White House lawn?

939
00:52:22,505 --> 00:52:25,921
Yeah.
He was given the honor of leading

940
00:52:26,005 --> 00:52:29,338
the presidential initiative
in getting kids to exercise.

941
00:52:29,421 --> 00:52:31,255
Get a little air into it, you lard-ass...

942
00:52:32,005 --> 00:52:34,338
You look like a goddamn bunch of pussies.

943
00:52:34,421 --> 00:52:36,671
- I'm sorry.
- He's just of another generation.

944
00:52:36,755 --> 00:52:38,088
You know, I used to date him.

945
00:52:38,171 --> 00:52:41,380
Know what happened to the last pussy
I worked with in combat?

946
00:52:41,463 --> 00:52:43,255
You ever see inside a man's torso?

947
00:52:47,421 --> 00:52:49,546
Benedict Drask reporting for duty.

948
00:52:51,713 --> 00:52:53,796
<i>- Thank you for the...</i>
- He's gonna be fantastic.

949
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,463
He's got a great voice.

950
00:52:55,546 --> 00:52:58,231
- We're gonna let him make a statement.
<i>- Some are saying this is a...</i>

951
00:52:58,255 --> 00:52:59,630
He's got a great body too.

952
00:52:59,713 --> 00:53:01,255
- <i>He does.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

953
00:53:01,338 --> 00:53:02,963
<i>...suicide mission.</i>

954
00:53:03,046 --> 00:53:04,463
Well, all I ask is,

955
00:53:05,546 --> 00:53:06,880
if I get snuffed,

956
00:53:08,046 --> 00:53:11,463
that you all earn
the extra living my sacrifice gives you.

957
00:53:11,546 --> 00:53:14,005
The extra living
my sacrifice gives them.

958
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:16,505
- Right?
- I wrote that.

959
00:53:16,588 --> 00:53:18,713
Isn't that from <i>Saving Private Ryan?</i>

960
00:53:18,796 --> 00:53:21,713
- Yes.
- No, that's something totally different.

961
00:53:21,796 --> 00:53:25,505
And special thanks should also go
to this team of scientists behind me...

962
00:53:25,588 --> 00:53:28,255
<i>We're gonna need
everybody's help on this.</i>

963
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:30,213
Everybody.

964
00:53:30,296 --> 00:53:33,921
All have to pitch in
and push out this message.

965
00:53:34,005 --> 00:53:35,463
...African-American scientist.

966
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:37,130
Miss Dibiasky, she...

967
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:40,588
And we have Kate Dibiasky,
who the comet is named after,

968
00:53:40,671 --> 00:53:42,463
but don't blame her.

969
00:53:42,546 --> 00:53:46,171
...connects with the disaffected youth
and the mentally ill.

970
00:53:46,255 --> 00:53:48,130
- And other marginal groups.
- Thank you.

971
00:53:48,213 --> 00:53:51,505
- We'll do whatever we can.
- As long as you do the right thing.

972
00:53:51,588 --> 00:53:52,921
We're there for you.

973
00:53:53,005 --> 00:53:56,255
Especially you, Dr. Mindy,
because you poll so much higher

974
00:53:56,338 --> 00:53:58,671
than your colleagues.
It's wild.

975
00:53:58,755 --> 00:54:04,255
He will help us destroy
our common enemy, Dibiasky.

976
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,046
Wonderful. Well, I think we're done.

977
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:08,671
Yep, okay. Let's go.

978
00:54:08,755 --> 00:54:10,296
Can I say something?

979
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:12,588
We've been dying to hear
what you gotta say.

980
00:54:13,255 --> 00:54:14,380
I didn't vote for you.

981
00:54:16,546 --> 00:54:22,713
But this is obviously
much bigger than my misgivings.

982
00:54:22,796 --> 00:54:27,130
So I will be 100% behind this effort.

983
00:54:28,005 --> 00:54:31,796
No matter how offensive I may find you.

984
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:34,380
Hmm. Wow. That's great.

985
00:54:34,463 --> 00:54:36,296
Yeah. That's really nice.

986
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:39,213
You know, I did have the FBI
put that bag over your head.

987
00:54:39,296 --> 00:54:42,296
They don't do that.
The CIA does, but I made them do it.

988
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:45,088
You know, I had a feeling. I really did.

989
00:54:45,963 --> 00:54:48,421
It's a good feeling
'cause that is what I did.

990
00:54:48,505 --> 00:54:51,296
- And it was very funny and cool.
- Okay.

991
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:55,463
May Jesus Christ
bless every single one of you,

992
00:54:56,213 --> 00:54:59,338
especially the honorable members
of my own party.

993
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,130
We will prevail.

994
00:55:31,713 --> 00:55:35,213
<i>We're all gonna die!</i>

995
00:55:35,296 --> 00:55:38,088
<i>Guys, this comet
is seriously stressing me out.</i>

996
00:55:38,171 --> 00:55:40,255
<i>Well, it's coming. People gotta dig in.</i>

997
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:42,713
<i>I already got buyers
for these shovels on e-market.</i>

998
00:55:42,796 --> 00:55:46,838
<i>Clean sweep for President Orlean
in these midterm elections.</i>

999
00:55:46,921 --> 00:55:49,255
- <i>...how hot he is.
- Thousand bucks a pop.</i>

1000
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:56,921
...discharge the duties
on which I am about to enter.

1001
00:55:57,005 --> 00:55:58,088
"So help you God."

1002
00:55:58,171 --> 00:56:00,421
- So help me God.
- Congratulations.

1003
00:56:01,713 --> 00:56:05,463
<i>We have talk of
a Nobel Peace Prize in the offing.</i>

1004
00:56:05,546 --> 00:56:08,838
<i>He's not hot.</i>

1005
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,046
<i>Hello, Sammy.</i>

1006
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:28,421
<i>Are you really a doctor?</i>

1007
00:56:28,505 --> 00:56:31,755
<i>Well, sort of. I'm an astronomer.</i>

1008
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:35,838
<i>Oh. What is an astronomer?</i>

1009
00:56:35,921 --> 00:56:38,713
Dr. Mindy, there is
a lot of fear out there,

1010
00:56:38,796 --> 00:56:40,546
uh, in America, around the world.

1011
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:42,713
Parents don't know
what to say to their kids.

1012
00:56:42,796 --> 00:56:45,296
What would you say to them
to help them understand?

1013
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:48,796
Well, I'm sure many of us
are frightened right now.

1014
00:56:49,463 --> 00:56:55,713
But I can assure you, our best
and our brightest, they're on the job.

1015
00:56:56,255 --> 00:57:00,463
I've seen the science
on this plan and it is sound.

1016
00:57:00,546 --> 00:57:05,213
I know your words are a great comfort
to all our viewers, Dr. Randall,

1017
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:09,421
<i>and we thank you
for your courage and your service.</i>

1018
00:57:09,505 --> 00:57:11,171
<i>I'd just like to say</i>

1019
00:57:11,796 --> 00:57:16,546
that whenever
I feel afraid or alone in this, I...

1020
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:21,005
<i>I think of you and I just... I feel better.</i>

1021
00:57:21,088 --> 00:57:22,380
<i>So thank you.</i>

1022
00:57:23,005 --> 00:57:24,380
<i>That's my job.</i>

1023
00:57:35,463 --> 00:57:37,588
- Tell me we're all gonna die.
- What?

1024
00:57:40,005 --> 00:57:42,505
- Tell me we're all gonna die, do it.
- We're all gonna die.

1025
00:57:42,588 --> 00:57:43,713
Oh, boy.

1026
00:57:43,796 --> 00:57:47,380
<i>So, these two Marxists
wave around the word "science"</i>

1027
00:57:47,463 --> 00:57:49,588
<i>and we're all supposed
to do whatever they say?</i>

1028
00:57:49,671 --> 00:57:52,296
<i>Yeah, how do we know
there even is a comet?</i>

1029
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:56,130
Mr. Pawketty, Congressman,
this data has been proven

1030
00:57:56,213 --> 00:58:00,463
and has been peer-reviewed
by hundreds of world-renowned scientists.

1031
00:58:00,546 --> 00:58:04,546
And we're supposed to trust you?
The comet's got your name.

1032
00:58:05,963 --> 00:58:07,921
I don't... I don't see the relevancy.

1033
00:58:08,005 --> 00:58:09,796
Why won't you
answer the question?

1034
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,921
- Answer the question.
- What's the question?

1035
00:58:12,005 --> 00:58:13,130
Grow up here, okay?

1036
00:58:13,213 --> 00:58:14,421
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

1037
00:58:16,421 --> 00:58:20,421
I've just realized, we don't really know
anything about each other. Do we?

1038
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:23,130
True.

1039
00:58:24,296 --> 00:58:27,671
Well, every time I try
to ask you about your life,

1040
00:58:27,755 --> 00:58:31,421
you seem to just tell me
about your favorite restaurants.

1041
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:33,546
Well, I... You know...

1042
00:58:34,255 --> 00:58:36,046
I just despise the, you know,

1043
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:38,296
getting-to-know-you part
of relationships, so...

1044
00:58:38,963 --> 00:58:41,005
Oh, okay. I understand.

1045
00:58:43,005 --> 00:58:45,213
Okay, let's just
get it over and done with.

1046
00:58:47,713 --> 00:58:48,921
Okay, uh...

1047
00:58:49,963 --> 00:58:51,713
Right, so, uh...

1048
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:56,838
My grandfather invented
the flash-freezing process.

1049
00:58:56,921 --> 00:58:59,171
So I come from grotesque money,

1050
00:58:59,255 --> 00:59:03,505
but I got away from it
by getting three masters degrees.

1051
00:59:04,296 --> 00:59:07,130
Uh, I've been divorced twice.

1052
00:59:07,213 --> 00:59:13,713
Uh, one was a Secretary of State,
and the other one was a sport fisherman.

1053
00:59:13,796 --> 00:59:19,671
Uh, I have slept
with two former presidents.

1054
00:59:19,755 --> 00:59:24,588
I speak four languages,
and I own two Monets.

1055
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:27,296
Wow.

1056
00:59:27,755 --> 00:59:29,963
Two former presidents. Wow.

1057
00:59:31,963 --> 00:59:33,880
- What, my turn?
- Yeah.

1058
00:59:33,963 --> 00:59:40,255
Oh. All right. My father was
a middle school geography teacher.

1059
00:59:40,338 --> 00:59:43,588
My mother,
she cut hair out of the kitchen.

1060
00:59:43,671 --> 00:59:47,505
Uh, about two years ago,
our family dog, JoJo, died,

1061
00:59:47,588 --> 00:59:49,588
which was really, really emotional.

1062
00:59:49,671 --> 00:59:53,046
I can't remember crying that much ever.

1063
00:59:54,588 --> 00:59:55,588
And, um...

1064
00:59:57,255 --> 01:00:02,546
I finally got my, uh, <i>Star Wars</i> poster
signed by Mark Hamill.

1065
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:04,713
It's in the garage. It's... So, yeah.

1066
01:00:05,588 --> 01:00:07,671
Okay, good.

1067
01:00:09,963 --> 01:00:10,963
That's done.

1068
01:00:11,463 --> 01:00:12,463
Ah...

1069
01:00:15,671 --> 01:00:17,963
Where are we gonna go for dinner tonight?

1070
01:00:26,338 --> 01:00:28,921
<i>The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.</i>

1071
01:00:29,005 --> 01:00:31,755
<i>He makes me to lie down in green pastures.</i>

1072
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:36,088
<i>He leads me beside the quiet waters.
He restores my soul.</i>

1073
01:00:36,171 --> 01:00:39,588
Not since D-Day have we seen
such a mass mobilization

1074
01:00:39,671 --> 01:00:43,421
of unions and resources
for such a noble task.

1075
01:00:44,046 --> 01:00:46,921
One cannot help but be moved
by the bravery, ingenuity,

1076
01:00:47,005 --> 01:00:49,088
and sacrifice on display here.

1077
01:01:09,546 --> 01:01:12,130
Okay, here we go, everyone.
Let's stay sharp.

1078
01:01:14,046 --> 01:01:17,421
I just want you to know,
this is the most propulsive thing

1079
01:01:17,505 --> 01:01:20,046
that's ever happened to me. Thank you.

1080
01:01:33,338 --> 01:01:36,546
<i>What's the holdup, you guys?
What are you waiting on?</i>

1081
01:01:37,505 --> 01:01:40,630
<i>Come on, motherfuckers,
let's light this fucking firecracker, huh?</i>

1082
01:01:41,171 --> 01:01:42,546
<i>Think I got all day?</i>

1083
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:47,213
Commander Drask,
this is your president speaking.

1084
01:01:48,463 --> 01:01:50,338
Your nation thanks you.

1085
01:01:51,088 --> 01:01:52,713
Your planet thanks you.

1086
01:01:53,421 --> 01:01:55,880
And God and I thank you.

1087
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:59,213
<i>Listen, the only thanks I need
is a shot of Jack Daniels</i>.

1088
01:01:59,296 --> 01:02:03,213
<i>And a couple DUIs to magically go away.</i>

1089
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:08,921
This is Mission Control.
All indicators are coming up green.

1090
01:02:09,005 --> 01:02:11,421
<i>This is a final warning
to control the launchpad.</i>

1091
01:02:11,505 --> 01:02:17,213
Your discovery led to this mission
and our chance to save Earth.

1092
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:19,671
I give you...

1093
01:02:22,046 --> 01:02:23,046
the honor.

1094
01:02:28,463 --> 01:02:29,463
Thank you.

1095
01:02:31,671 --> 01:02:34,963
Thank you,
Madam President.

1096
01:02:36,463 --> 01:02:38,838
Citizens of planet Earth,

1097
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:43,046
<i>everything is theoretically impossible</i>

1098
01:02:43,713 --> 01:02:45,130
<i>until it is done.</i>

1099
01:02:46,255 --> 01:02:47,546
<i>And with that,</i>

1100
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,755
we are go for launch.

1101
01:02:49,838 --> 01:02:50,713
Yes.

1102
01:02:50,796 --> 01:02:52,463
- That's fire.
- Thank you.

1103
01:02:52,546 --> 01:02:53,546
It was lit.

1104
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:58,088
Hey, everyone, mind if I join?

1105
01:02:59,130 --> 01:03:01,005
- Hello.
- Hello, Peter. Hi.

1106
01:03:01,088 --> 01:03:04,713
Hi. Oh, Brie, you look fabulous.

1107
01:03:04,796 --> 01:03:05,796
As always.

1108
01:03:06,963 --> 01:03:08,338
Is he allowed to be in here?

1109
01:03:08,421 --> 01:03:12,296
Yeah, he's a Platinum Eagle level donor
to the campaign. He has full clearance.

1110
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:14,005
<i>Launch mission array.</i>

1111
01:03:14,088 --> 01:03:17,630
Molly kicking in right now.
Timed that shit perfect.

1112
01:03:17,713 --> 01:03:20,671

1119
01:04:09,630 --> 01:04:11,588
We didn't lose
any satellites.

1120
01:04:11,671 --> 01:04:14,921
Margin of error
was for two to malfunction.

1121
01:04:15,005 --> 01:04:19,171
Hey, Madam President, may I have a word
with you outside for a moment, please?

1122
01:04:19,796 --> 01:04:20,921
Oh, my God.

1123
01:04:21,005 --> 01:04:23,796
Mission success probability
is already increased to 81%.

1124
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,880
Outstanding.

1125
01:04:26,588 --> 01:04:27,788
Janie, now!

1126
01:04:27,838 --> 01:04:30,588
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1127
01:04:30,671 --> 01:04:32,255
Peter, I didn't mean...

1128
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:41,713
<i>And a big hello to that beautiful
blue ball down there we all call home.</i>

1129

<i>God bless you.</i>

1131
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,130
Just a different generation. Yeah.

1132
01:04:50,796 --> 01:04:53,671
I also wanna say hello
to all the Indians out there.

1133
01:04:53,755 --> 01:04:54,838
Both kinds.

1134
01:04:54,921 --> 01:04:59,046
<i>You know, the ones with the elephants
and the ones with the bow and arrows.</i>

1136
01:05:01,588 --> 01:05:03,463
<i>How cool would that be, huh?</i>

1137
01:05:03,546 --> 01:05:05,463
<i>I wanna say hello
to all the gays out there.</i>

1138
01:05:05,546 --> 01:05:07,880
- Commander, booster ejection is imminent.
<i>- Huh?</i>

1139
01:05:07,963 --> 01:05:10,213
- Let's keep comm on mission.
<i>- Oh. Roger that.</i>

1140
01:05:20,755 --> 01:05:22,671
<i>Separation confirmed.</i>

1141
01:05:22,755 --> 01:05:24,505
<i>- Separation confirmed.</i>
- Whoo!

1142
01:05:29,088 --> 01:05:30,171
Was that French?

1143
01:05:31,463 --> 01:05:37,005
Yes, it is. It means, "the angels soar
to the heavens." It's, um...

1144
01:05:38,338 --> 01:05:42,463
It's from a 14th-century poem
I studied in Dartmouth.

1145
01:05:42,546 --> 01:05:45,880
And just watching this,
it just made me think of it,

1146
01:05:47,005 --> 01:05:48,421
and think of you.

1147
01:05:49,505 --> 01:05:50,505
God, I can't...

1148
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:52,380
Can't...

1149
01:06:01,588 --> 01:06:04,130
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

1150
01:06:05,796 --> 01:06:08,676
<i>I think I probably should go to the</i>
<i>hospital and see what they...</i>

1151
01:06:08,755 --> 01:06:10,713
<i>Launch challenge!</i>

1152
01:06:10,796 --> 01:06:13,671
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

1153
01:06:17,463 --> 01:06:19,588
Everyone, I have just received

1154
01:06:19,671 --> 01:06:23,421
some critical information
concerning our mission.

1155
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:34,296
Looks like it's turning around.

1156
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:40,255
No, it's not. It's a course correction.

1157
01:06:40,338 --> 01:06:41,880
It's pretty standard.

1158
01:06:41,963 --> 01:06:43,421
I was in the Navy.

1159
01:06:45,088 --> 01:06:47,380
Nope. It's turning around.

1160
01:06:47,463 --> 01:06:51,171
Seems to be
some confusion here amongst the crowd,

1161
01:06:51,255 --> 01:06:52,880
but I'm not gonna lie to you.

1162
01:06:52,963 --> 01:06:55,921
This reporter
is at a loss for words right now.

1163
01:06:56,005 --> 01:06:59,213
It's definitely turning around.

1164
01:06:59,296 --> 01:07:01,421
I'm looking straight at it.

1165
01:07:01,505 --> 01:07:05,505
Drask's ship is definitely turning around.

1166
01:07:07,921 --> 01:07:10,296
Does anyone know
what the fuck just happened?

1167
01:07:16,213 --> 01:07:17,588
It's still locked.

1168
01:07:17,671 --> 01:07:20,380
I just don't... I don't understand
what could've happened.

1169
01:07:20,463 --> 01:07:23,255
I mean, the mission was working, right?
Everything was on track.

1170
01:07:23,338 --> 01:07:26,171
Yeah. I mean,
it could've been anything, uh...

1171
01:07:26,255 --> 01:07:31,963
Guidance system could've malfunctioned,
uh, nuke destabilized, myriad of things.

1172
01:07:32,588 --> 01:07:35,630
Who was that guy that walked into
the Situation Room? He looked familiar.

1173
01:07:35,713 --> 01:07:42,088
That was Peter Isherwell, CEO of BASH,
and the third richest human ever.

1174
01:07:42,171 --> 01:07:46,130
He's the guy that, uh, bought
the Gutenberg Bible and lost it.

1175
01:07:47,421 --> 01:07:48,921
Sorry to keep you waiting.

1176
01:07:49,005 --> 01:07:51,838
Things are, uh, extremely fluid.

1177
01:07:53,296 --> 01:07:56,921
Dr. Randall, you are now the Chief
Science Advisor to the White House.

1178
01:07:57,005 --> 01:07:57,838
What?

1179
01:07:57,921 --> 01:08:00,671
As such, you need to attend
an emergency Cabinet meeting

1180
01:08:00,755 --> 01:08:02,005
where you will be debriefed.

1181
01:08:02,088 --> 01:08:03,088
What about us?

1182
01:08:03,671 --> 01:08:06,171
You do not have clearance
for this, sweetheart. Don't trip.

1183
01:08:06,255 --> 01:08:09,005
Got you some crackers, some waters.

1184
01:08:09,088 --> 01:08:10,755
You don't need to throw it on the floor.

1185
01:08:10,838 --> 01:08:12,380
Gonna be three, four hours, tops.

1186
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:15,588
Here, Kate. I don't know
why he threw 'em down. Here.

1187
01:08:15,671 --> 01:08:17,755
What if we have to go to the bathroom?

1188
01:08:17,838 --> 01:08:21,255
We'll lay out some newspaper for you.
Grab you a can of Febreze.

1189
01:08:21,338 --> 01:08:23,213
Short, sweet
and simple science.

1190
01:08:23,296 --> 01:08:24,963
I'll be back. All right. Come on.

1191
01:08:25,046 --> 01:08:27,088
Science tells the truth, Randall.

1192
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,505
Fuck. Do you wanna come?

1193
01:08:30,588 --> 01:08:31,588
Yeah.

1194
01:08:33,630 --> 01:08:35,630
Ladies and gentlemen,
what we thought,

1195
01:08:35,713 --> 01:08:40,713
what the world thought
was an impending and terrifying danger,

1196
01:08:41,921 --> 01:08:44,630
turns out to be
an astonishing opportunity.

1197
01:08:44,713 --> 01:08:47,171
Our allies are very confused
and demanding answers...

1198
01:08:47,255 --> 01:08:48,546
Well, tell 'em to wait.

1199
01:08:49,588 --> 01:08:54,671
According to the most recent
spectrometer readings of Comet Dibiasky,

1200
01:08:54,755 --> 01:08:57,838
made by the astrogeologists
at BASH Cellular,

1201
01:08:59,588 --> 01:09:01,296
we've discovered something.

1202
01:09:02,255 --> 01:09:05,005
Something truly miraculous.

1203
01:09:06,463 --> 01:09:08,130
Peter. Peter?

1204
01:09:08,213 --> 01:09:10,005
Oh, thank you, Janie.

1205
01:09:12,213 --> 01:09:14,713
As, uh... As some of you may know,

1206
01:09:14,796 --> 01:09:17,546
the most valuable minerals in the world

1207
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:19,755
are fast becoming those that are deployed

1208
01:09:19,838 --> 01:09:24,005
in the manufacture
of cell phones and, uh, computers.

1209
01:09:24,088 --> 01:09:27,588
Yttrium, terbium, osmium, dysprosium,
on and on and on.

1210
01:09:27,671 --> 01:09:29,005
We're running short.

1211
01:09:29,088 --> 01:09:31,921
Uh, and the problem
is exacerbated, of course,

1212
01:09:32,005 --> 01:09:37,921
because China has her big panda paw
firmly on almost all the mines

1213
01:09:38,005 --> 01:09:41,505
that produce
these valuable rare Earth assets.

1214
01:09:41,588 --> 01:09:43,630
So you can imagine.

1215
01:09:43,713 --> 01:09:44,713
Wow!

1216
01:09:44,755 --> 01:09:48,546
Just how happy we were at BASH

1217
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:52,255
when our astrogeologists discovered

1218
01:09:52,338 --> 01:09:57,005
and then determined that this comet,
hurtling towards us from deep space,

1219
01:09:57,088 --> 01:10:02,838
actually contains at least $32 trillion
of these critical materials.

1220
01:10:02,921 --> 01:10:04,671
Critical to technology.

1221
01:10:04,755 --> 01:10:05,963
If we're to proceed...

1222
01:10:06,046 --> 01:10:08,546
I'm sorry. Is that why
you aborted this entire mission,

1223
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:11,546
is because you're trying to mine
the comet for rare minerals?

1224
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:13,713
I think
we should hold all questions

1225
01:10:13,796 --> 01:10:16,463
until the end of the presentation,

1226
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:20,130
and you might find
that your questions are answered.

1227
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,755
Yes, Madam President.

1228
01:10:21,838 --> 01:10:24,880
When you...
When the other metals are factored in,

1229
01:10:24,963 --> 01:10:27,338
the comet actually contains

1230
01:10:27,421 --> 01:10:31,546
almost $140 trillion worth of assets.

1231
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:32,921
Buck-forty trilli.

1232
01:10:33,421 --> 01:10:35,296
Yeah...

1233
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:40,005
What do these trillions of dollars
even matter if we're all gonna die...

1234
01:10:40,088 --> 01:10:42,463
I was about to ask
the same question, Janie.

1235
01:10:42,546 --> 01:10:43,671
Why weren't we consulted?

1236
01:10:43,755 --> 01:10:45,255
All due respect, Madam President...

1237
01:10:45,338 --> 01:10:47,838
Oh, no! What if we're rich and we're safe?

1238
01:10:49,005 --> 01:10:53,130
I've gone over it
again and again and again in my head

1239
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,796
and I still can't make sense of it.

1240
01:10:58,755 --> 01:11:03,796
He's a three-star general.
He works at the Pentagon.

1241
01:11:05,921 --> 01:11:09,005
Why would he charge us for free snacks?

1242
01:11:09,088 --> 01:11:12,755
One time, I met Sting,

1243
01:11:13,713 --> 01:11:18,296
and I swear to God,
he farted right in front of me.

1244
01:11:19,338 --> 01:11:24,463
Didn't break eye contact
and didn't even say "excuse me."

1245
01:11:27,505 --> 01:11:31,088
And the thing is,
he actually pulled it off.

1246
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:34,880
'Cause I still found him
to be quite charming.

1247
01:11:35,921 --> 01:11:40,338
Guys, we have to talk.
Come on, let's go. Come on, now.

1248
01:11:41,421 --> 01:11:44,630
It's insane. Like, completely insane.

1249
01:11:44,713 --> 01:11:46,046
It will never work.

1250
01:11:46,130 --> 01:11:48,296
I had the exact same reaction.

1251
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:51,505
This is a nine-kilometer-wide
planet-killer we're talking about,

1252
01:11:51,588 --> 01:11:53,046
not roaming charges.

1253
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:59,046
Look, I... I was confused and outraged
that they turned this mission around too,

1254
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:01,713
but they've got
Gary Talcamont from Stanford

1255
01:12:01,796 --> 01:12:03,963
and Lisa Inez from Princeton
on their team.

1256
01:12:04,046 --> 01:12:07,755
I mean, this is next-generation
cutting-edge technology.

1257
01:12:07,838 --> 01:12:14,630
Obviously, one giant comet is a major
and existential, uh, threat to our planet,

1258
01:12:14,713 --> 01:12:20,005
but 30 smaller meteoroids, we can handle.

1259
01:12:20,921 --> 01:12:26,630
Our BEADS, that stands for
BASH, uh, Explore and Acquire Drones,

1260
01:12:26,713 --> 01:12:28,088
that you see here,

1261
01:12:28,171 --> 01:12:30,838
attach themselves to the comet

1262
01:12:30,921 --> 01:12:33,380
and scan it with nanotechnology

1263
01:12:33,463 --> 01:12:36,588
developed by
Nobel Prize-winning scientist,

1264
01:12:36,671 --> 01:12:37,671
Dr. Gary Talcamont.

1265
01:12:37,755 --> 01:12:40,505
And then we immediately deploy, don't we?

1266
01:12:40,588 --> 01:12:42,838
Nobel and Polonsky prize-winning scientist

1267
01:12:42,921 --> 01:12:48,255
Dr. Inez's micro-targeted,
quantum fission, uh, explosives.

1268
01:12:48,338 --> 01:12:51,630
You see, deep into the object...

1269
01:12:51,713 --> 01:12:54,463
Dr. Inez, would you like
to explain what's happening?

1270
01:12:54,546 --> 01:12:55,421
Thank you, Peter.

1271
01:12:55,505 --> 01:12:58,255
We've been developing
phase-fission reactions

1272
01:12:58,338 --> 01:13:00,380
in the CERN particle accelerator

1273
01:13:00,463 --> 01:13:03,130
that can splinter the comet
into smaller pieces

1274
01:13:03,213 --> 01:13:05,338
with breathtaking accuracy.

1275
01:13:05,421 --> 01:13:08,796
These segments are then steered
and decelerated by each BEAD

1276
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:13,630
into the Pacific Ocean for reclamation
by waiting US Navy ships.

1277
01:13:13,713 --> 01:13:15,671
And when these... Thank you.

1278
01:13:15,755 --> 01:13:19,880
And when these treasures
from heaven are claimed,

1279
01:13:19,963 --> 01:13:23,921
poverty as we know it,
social injustice, loss of biodiversity,

1280
01:13:24,005 --> 01:13:26,713
all these multitudes of problems

1281
01:13:26,796 --> 01:13:30,130
are just gonna become relics of the past

1282
01:13:30,213 --> 01:13:35,630
and humanity is gonna stride through
the Pillars of Boaz and Jachin naked

1283
01:13:35,713 --> 01:13:38,255
into the the glory of a golden age...

1284
01:13:38,338 --> 01:13:41,505
And is this nanotech work peer-reviewed?

1285
01:13:41,588 --> 01:13:45,171
Well, I haven't reviewed the data,
but it's been modeled.

1286
01:13:45,255 --> 01:13:47,130
Has any of this been peer-reviewed?

1287
01:13:48,005 --> 01:13:48,838
Nope.

1288
01:13:48,921 --> 01:13:51,255
Interplanetary, interstellar,

1289
01:13:51,338 --> 01:13:56,130
intergalactic existence
for the human race.

1290
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:00,921
Your mouth to God's ear.

1291
01:14:01,463 --> 01:14:05,046
I understand the wealth
that they can extract from this comet,

1292
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:06,296
it can end world hunger.

1293
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:08,171
Oh, I see.

1294
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:10,838
- Why are you laughing?
- That's true. No, I see.

1295
01:14:10,921 --> 01:14:15,338
So that's the pretty little bow they're
putting around this line of bullshit.

1296
01:14:15,421 --> 01:14:17,255
I bet they'll say freedom and puppies too.

1297
01:14:17,338 --> 01:14:18,171
- All right.
- Yeah.

1298
01:14:18,255 --> 01:14:21,921
You want me to quit the mission?
I'll quit the mission. That's fine.

1299
01:14:22,421 --> 01:14:25,713
But you have to understand,
this is now beyond our control.

1300
01:14:25,796 --> 01:14:27,213
They have all the power.

1301
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,963
So who do you want
in the actual room to make sure

1302
01:14:30,046 --> 01:14:33,005
this whole thing doesn't turn out to be
a complete goddamn disaster?

1303
01:14:33,088 --> 01:14:35,713
Jason Orlean?
You want Jason Orlean in that room? Huh?

1304
01:14:35,796 --> 01:14:40,130
I have news for you.
It's already a complete disaster.

1305
01:14:40,213 --> 01:14:43,755
They're talking about letting
a comet the size of a mountain

1306
01:14:43,838 --> 01:14:46,630
hit the planet to jack up
a cell phone company's stock!

1307
01:14:46,713 --> 01:14:49,921
You better take that down
about four or five notches now.

1308
01:14:50,005 --> 01:14:53,630
Were you yelling about that mission?
Why were you talking about cell phones?

1309
01:14:53,713 --> 01:14:56,755
My friend was just theorizing
as to what's going on.

1310
01:14:56,838 --> 01:14:58,296
We're confused too.

1311
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:01,463
That's an awfully official-looking
White House badge you got there.

1312
01:15:01,546 --> 01:15:03,296
I don't know why I have this on.

1313
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:05,130
Listen, just tell us what's going on.

1314
01:15:05,213 --> 01:15:07,630
I got three scared kids at home.
Just tell us something.

1315
01:15:07,713 --> 01:15:10,338
I understand.
I wish I could share information, but...

1316
01:15:10,421 --> 01:15:12,963
We're people just like you.
We deserve to know!

1317
01:15:13,046 --> 01:15:14,046
They're right.

1318
01:15:14,963 --> 01:15:16,088
They deserve to know.

1319
01:15:17,005 --> 01:15:18,838
Do you really wanna know what's going on?

1320
01:15:18,921 --> 01:15:20,106
- Yeah.
- Please.

1321
01:15:20,130 --> 01:15:22,588
- Kate, don't. Kate.
- Kate.

1322
01:15:23,546 --> 01:15:28,963
They found a bunch of gold and diamonds
and rare shit on the comet.

1323
01:15:29,963 --> 01:15:32,171
So they're gonna let it hit the planet

1324
01:15:32,255 --> 01:15:36,421
to make a bunch of rich people
even more disgustingly rich!

1325
01:15:42,921 --> 01:15:44,005
Fuck you!

1326
01:15:54,713 --> 01:15:56,505
No camera!

1327
01:15:56,588 --> 01:15:58,546
...everything I could, they won't listen.

1328
01:15:58,630 --> 01:15:59,963
Surprise, surprise.

1329
01:16:00,046 --> 01:16:02,921
Now, I'm starting to think
you just like riling people up.

1330
01:16:03,005 --> 01:16:04,963
I'm so sorry, Kate. Really, I am.

1331
01:16:05,046 --> 01:16:07,046
Oh, Randall. God.

1332
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:09,880
Where's Brie Evantee?

1333
01:16:09,963 --> 01:16:12,380
Shouldn't you two
be playing footsie in a restaurant

1334
01:16:12,463 --> 01:16:14,588
that only serves cubes and foam?

1335
01:16:14,671 --> 01:16:18,088
Well, she ain't wrong.
You did lose the thread in a big way.

1336
01:16:18,171 --> 01:16:21,380
And what do you suggest we do?
An online petition, huh?

1337
01:16:21,463 --> 01:16:24,421
You want to hold...
Get a mob and hold up picket signs?

1338
01:16:24,505 --> 01:16:26,963
You wanna overthrow the government?
I mean, look at this.

1339
01:16:27,046 --> 01:16:28,880
I can't! My head is in a bag!

1340
01:16:28,963 --> 01:16:31,588
Sorry, Dr. Mindy.
White House wants her off the grid.

1341
01:16:31,671 --> 01:16:33,171
- Come on, now. Look...
- Now.

1342
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:35,963
Wait. What does that mean?
What the hell does that mean?

1343
01:16:36,046 --> 01:16:38,421
- What does "off the grid" mean?
- Hey, Kate.

1344
01:16:39,296 --> 01:16:42,421
Oh, gosh. Kate! Are you okay?

1345
01:16:45,546 --> 01:16:48,838
Teddy, come on!
What choice do I have here?

1346
01:16:51,171 --> 01:16:53,546
A man's always got choices, Randall!

1347
01:16:53,630 --> 01:16:56,463
Sometimes you just gotta
choose the good one!

1348
01:17:03,088 --> 01:17:04,713
Miss Katelyn Dibiasky,

1349
01:17:04,796 --> 01:17:08,213
the charges against you are
violation of national security secrets,

1350
01:17:08,296 --> 01:17:11,088
inciting a riot,
and destruction of private property

1351
01:17:11,171 --> 01:17:13,671
owned by Bojo Mambo's Shrimp LLC.

1352
01:17:13,755 --> 01:17:14,588
What? I didn't...

1353
01:17:14,671 --> 01:17:17,588
However, the Attorney General
is willing to not pursue prosecution

1354
01:17:17,671 --> 01:17:19,213
if you will agree to the following:

1355
01:17:19,296 --> 01:17:21,963
"The suspension
of all public media appearances

1356
01:17:22,046 --> 01:17:26,713
and incendiary language relating to
Comet Dibiasky and BASH Cellular."

1357
01:17:28,921 --> 01:17:32,338
Fine. Give it to me.
I don't give a shit anymore.

1358
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:49,421
Mom. Dad.

1359
01:17:49,921 --> 01:17:52,171
I'm so glad to be home.

1360
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:55,880
Unlock the door.

1361
01:17:55,963 --> 01:17:57,755
No politics. None.

1362
01:17:58,213 --> 01:17:59,588
What are you talking about?

1363
01:18:00,088 --> 01:18:02,796
Your dad and I are for the jobs
the comet will provide.

1364
01:18:05,713 --> 01:18:07,921
The divisions in this country
are bad enough.

1365
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:10,463
We don't want more of that in our house.

1366
01:18:11,921 --> 01:18:14,213
<i>Whoa!</i>

1367
01:18:14,296 --> 01:18:16,130
<i>- Slow down, kids.</i>
<i>- Sorry, Mom.</i>

1368
01:18:17,296 --> 01:18:19,338
<i>I worry about my kids and their future.</i>

1369
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:22,505
<i>Sure, the jobs
the comet's gonna create sound great.</i>

1370
01:18:23,046 --> 01:18:24,296
<i>What if it's not safe?</i>

1371
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:29,255
<i>Right now, millions of you are having
these same doubts and questions</i>

1372
01:18:29,338 --> 01:18:31,213
<i>about the approaching comet.</i>

1373
01:18:31,296 --> 01:18:32,713
<i>That is why BASH Cellular</i>

1374
01:18:32,796 --> 01:18:35,171
<i>in conjunction with
the United States Government</i>

1375
01:18:35,255 --> 01:18:40,046
<i>is creating a new hotline, free of charge,
to answer all of your questions.</i>

1376
01:18:40,755 --> 01:18:46,130
<i>And who knows? Maybe,
just maybe, one of our scientists...</i>

1377
01:18:46,213 --> 01:18:49,546
<i>Thank you, Sharon.
Makes me feel so much better.</i>

1378
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:53,838
<i>...can be that friend we all need
to lean on during uncertain times.</i>

1379
01:18:55,213 --> 01:18:58,755
<i>Call 1-800-532-4500 for peace of mind.</i>

1380
01:18:58,838 --> 01:19:00,463
<i>Offer only available to BASH customers.</i>

1381
01:19:00,546 --> 01:19:02,921
<i>Details of your call may be shared
with other subsidiaries</i>

1382
01:19:03,005 --> 01:19:05,921
<i>to enhance your customer experience.
Data and roaming charges apply.</i>

1383
01:19:06,005 --> 01:19:09,421
So, I thought he was
the ambassador. I was just flattering him.

1384
01:19:09,505 --> 01:19:13,546
Well, he was a waiter.
Now he's got an ego the size of Texas.

1385
01:19:16,921 --> 01:19:18,130
Oh, my God.

1386
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:22,880
June, what, uh...
What are you doing here, sweetie?

1387
01:19:24,713 --> 01:19:27,463
Had a feeling
something was going on and just...

1388
01:19:28,338 --> 01:19:31,963
Well, you know,
we're discussing important business.

1389
01:19:32,046 --> 01:19:35,463
- That's what we're doing.
- Oh, yeah, that's really very important.

1390
01:19:35,546 --> 01:19:37,755
Oh, can we just
skip past this part, please?

1391
01:19:37,838 --> 01:19:39,505
Where you get to feel self-righteous

1392
01:19:39,588 --> 01:19:43,046
and we put our tails between our legs.
It is just so boring.

1393
01:19:43,130 --> 01:19:44,796
Oh, it's "so boring"?

1394
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:49,296
You wanna skip the part where
you feel bad for screwing my husband?

1395
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:52,588
Oh... No, I don't feel bad.

1396
01:19:52,671 --> 01:19:56,421
Randall and I are having a wonderful time.
So, I think the question is,

1397
01:19:56,505 --> 01:20:01,796
do we keep having a wonderful time
or does he go back with you to Wisconsin?

1398
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:02,755
Or Montana.

1399
01:20:02,838 --> 01:20:04,880
- Michigan?
- Michigan.

1400
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:12,505
You know, um... she is actually right.

1401
01:20:13,296 --> 01:20:16,338
That's the only question. So...

1402
01:20:18,963 --> 01:20:20,755
Well, June, sweetie...

1403
01:20:20,838 --> 01:20:23,880
Sometimes in life things are, you know,

1404
01:20:23,963 --> 01:20:26,463
they're complicated and they just...

1405
01:20:26,546 --> 01:20:27,671
Oh, okay.

1406
01:20:29,963 --> 01:20:31,671
Oh, that was fast, um...

1407
01:20:35,255 --> 01:20:38,380
Well, before I go, um,

1408
01:20:38,463 --> 01:20:41,380
let me just give you some instructions

1409
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:45,463
on how to take care of Randall.

1410
01:20:46,088 --> 01:20:47,088
Uh...

1411
01:20:47,130 --> 01:20:50,546
Yeah, here's the Xanax
he takes for his panic attacks.

1412
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:51,463
Oh, gosh.

1413
01:20:51,546 --> 01:20:54,463
Here's the Zoloft he takes
for the crashing depressions.

1414
01:20:54,546 --> 01:20:58,255
- Not so much recently. Okay, you know...
- Oh! Oh, good for you. Great.

1415
01:20:58,338 --> 01:21:02,005
- Uh, this is for his blood pressure.
- Ow.

1416
01:21:02,088 --> 01:21:04,713
- Restless leg syndrome, that's a fun one.
- God.

1417
01:21:06,713 --> 01:21:10,880
Oh. Appetite suppressant to counteract
the weight gain from his other meds.

1418
01:21:10,963 --> 01:21:15,880
And, uh, for America's sexiest scientist,
a bottle of goddamn Cialis!

1419
01:21:15,963 --> 01:21:17,380
Ow! Gosh.

1420
01:21:26,588 --> 01:21:28,046
Goodbye. Goodbye, Randall.

1421
01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:29,921
I guess I'll just tell your sons

1422
01:21:30,005 --> 01:21:32,380
that Dad's fucking
the lady on our television.

1423
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:34,796
June, I...

1424
01:21:36,255 --> 01:21:38,463
I really thought for a second
that was gonna work out.

1425
01:21:40,338 --> 01:21:43,671
<i>People, they wanna
manage the comet to create jobs.</i>

1426
01:21:43,755 --> 01:21:45,796
<i>Thirty-seven percent
don't want the comet to hit.</i>

1427
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,588
<i>That's actually down by three points.</i>

1428
01:21:47,671 --> 01:21:50,796
<i>And 23%, they don't think
there's a comet at all,</i>

1429
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,671
<i>and that number is way up.</i>

1430
01:21:53,505 --> 01:21:56,796
Not Bitcoin, RatCoin. RatCoin.

1431
01:21:59,588 --> 01:22:01,838
I'd like to buy these sunglasses.

1432
01:22:10,171 --> 01:22:12,463
You that girl from live TV
who said we're all gonna die?

1433
01:22:13,046 --> 01:22:14,963
No. What's your purchase?

1434
01:22:19,296 --> 01:22:20,296
What the fuck?

1435
01:22:20,338 --> 01:22:23,046
- Yeah, that's you. It's definitely you.
- Yep, that's me.

1436
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:26,838
Holy shit. You're a stone-cold legend.
Word is bond.

1437
01:22:28,130 --> 01:22:29,588
I got a picture of you on my board.

1438
01:22:29,671 --> 01:22:31,046
Picture on his fucking board.

1439
01:22:31,130 --> 01:22:33,130
That's great. What's your purchase?

1440
01:22:33,213 --> 01:22:36,421
If you don't have one, get out of line
and make room for other customers.

1441
01:22:36,505 --> 01:22:38,796
Can I touch your hair in a non-sexual way?

1442
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,546
- Get the fuck away from me.
- Oh, dude, have some... Um...

1443
01:22:42,588 --> 01:22:45,046
Call Diogo, he'll freak out.
Will you say hi to my friend?

1444
01:22:45,130 --> 01:22:47,755
Dude, he's obsessed with you.
We love you. We don't like...

1445
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:49,255
Can't stand Orlean, either.

1446
01:22:49,338 --> 01:22:53,421
- Yo, yo, yo!
<i>- Yo!</i>

1447
01:22:53,505 --> 01:22:54,588
What's up? Yo, check out...

1448
01:22:54,671 --> 01:22:57,088
Yo, shut the fuck up.
Check out who we're with.

1449
01:22:57,171 --> 01:22:59,838
- Yo, bro! What up?
<i>- What up?</i>

1450
01:23:01,255 --> 01:23:03,963
I mean, we have a purchase,
but we don't have payment,

1451
01:23:04,046 --> 01:23:05,588
which is a metaphor on...

1452
01:23:07,213 --> 01:23:09,296
- Cash?
<i>- Also, Phillip, I've been told...</i>

1453
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:10,731
- Right.
<i>- ...that you wrote a book</i>

1454
01:23:10,755 --> 01:23:13,463
<i>about your past relationship
with Kate Dibiasky.</i>

1455
01:23:13,546 --> 01:23:15,963
<i>Funny you should say that,
I'm working on that now.</i>

1456
01:23:16,046 --> 01:23:18,588
<i>It's gonna be called</i>
A Brush With The Devil, <i>and it's, uh...</i>

1457
01:23:18,671 --> 01:23:20,796
You calling security
or something, with your eyes?

1458
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,130
No. You're free to go.

1459
01:23:22,213 --> 01:23:24,338
- <i>That sounds terrible.</i>
- Just like that?

1460
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:27,130
You don't give a shit, do you?

1461
01:23:28,963 --> 01:23:29,963
Sure, I do.

1462
01:23:30,046 --> 01:23:33,046
I care about DrinkMo's guarantee
of quality service.

1463
01:23:33,671 --> 01:23:35,505
Well, we don't give a shit either.

1464
01:23:35,588 --> 01:23:37,213
Not one single shit.

1465
01:23:37,296 --> 01:23:40,296
We hang and board behind the abandoned
Burger Crown from 7:00 to whenever.

1466
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:41,213
Yeah, we do.

1467
01:23:41,296 --> 01:23:43,755
You should come hang.
If you're not a fucking pussy.

1468
01:23:46,671 --> 01:23:48,338
<i>Oh, you know, it's me...</i>

1469
01:23:48,421 --> 01:23:50,963
- Fuck. Okay. Thanks.
<i>- ...and a bottle of scotch.</i>

1470
01:23:51,963 --> 01:23:54,505
<i>It's a joke. But also...</i>

1471
01:24:06,546 --> 01:24:09,088
Okay, let me introduce you

1472
01:24:09,963 --> 01:24:16,338
uh, to mankind's savior,
BASH Explore and Acquire Drone.

1473
01:24:16,421 --> 01:24:17,505
It's incredible.

1474
01:24:17,588 --> 01:24:19,130
It's incredible, isn't it?

1475
01:24:19,213 --> 01:24:22,838
I call this one Primo,
the first.

1476
01:24:22,921 --> 01:24:24,421
It's like my first child.

1477
01:24:25,088 --> 01:24:31,296
Primo, my boy.
It's your father, Cronos.

1478
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:35,046
Don't be shy. Come on.
You're gonna be a god in the sky.

1479
01:24:41,421 --> 01:24:46,588
Are you at all concerned about
the sync on the BEAD explosions?

1480
01:24:46,671 --> 01:24:50,588
Oh, Doctor. There are always
questions and fears, and...

1481
01:24:51,255 --> 01:24:54,505
I have a report here from a Dr. Inez.

1482
01:24:54,588 --> 01:24:57,046
- If you'd just take a look at this study.
- Oh, thanks.

1483
01:24:57,130 --> 01:24:59,338
Listen, a lot of my colleagues,

1484
01:24:59,421 --> 01:25:01,880
they've either been removed
or resigned from this project,

1485
01:25:01,963 --> 01:25:06,088
apparently for asking too many questions
about this mission here.

1486
01:25:06,171 --> 01:25:08,755
So I just wanna make sure that you're...

1487
01:25:09,338 --> 01:25:11,880
That you're open
to the scientific peer-review process

1488
01:25:11,963 --> 01:25:14,588
and you're not approaching
this mission like a businessman.

1489
01:25:14,671 --> 01:25:16,421
- You know? That...
- What did you say?

1490
01:25:16,921 --> 01:25:20,213
- I wanna know if you're...
- Did you call me a businessman?

1491
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:23,921
- You do own a corporate...
- You think I'm just a businessman?

1492
01:25:25,505 --> 01:25:27,796
Do you think you know me, Doctor?

1493
01:25:29,380 --> 01:25:30,380
Business?

1494
01:25:31,255 --> 01:25:35,130
This is evolution.
This is evolution of the human species.

1495
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:38,189
- What are you doing bringing this...
- Well...

1496
01:25:38,213 --> 01:25:41,380
You know that BASH has
over 40 million data points on you,

1497
01:25:41,463 --> 01:25:45,463
on every decision you have made
since 1994, Doctor?

1498
01:25:45,546 --> 01:25:50,046
I... I know when you have colon polyps

1499
01:25:50,130 --> 01:25:51,838
months before your doctor does.

1500
01:25:51,921 --> 01:25:53,755
You got four or five
at the moment actually.

1501
01:25:53,838 --> 01:25:57,380
You know, they're not of concern,
but I'd have a checkup as soon as you can.

1502
01:25:57,463 --> 01:26:01,921
But much more importantly than that,
I know what <i>you</i> are. I know who you are.

1503
01:26:02,005 --> 01:26:07,005
My algorithms have determined
eight fundamental consumer profile types.

1504
01:26:07,088 --> 01:26:10,796
You are a lifestyle idealist.

1505
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:15,130
You think you're motivated
by beliefs, high ethical beliefs.

1506
01:26:15,213 --> 01:26:20,130
But you just run towards pleasure
and away from pain.

1507
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:25,005
Like a... Like a field mouse.

1508
01:26:27,130 --> 01:26:28,505
I'm just trying to...

1509
01:26:29,921 --> 01:26:32,880
I just wanna make sure
that the science is sound on this project.

1510
01:26:32,963 --> 01:26:34,046
I hope you understand...

1511
01:26:34,130 --> 01:26:38,255
Our algorithms
can even predict how you'll die.

1512
01:26:39,130 --> 01:26:44,380
To 96... 96.5% accuracy.

1513
01:26:44,463 --> 01:26:46,338
I looked you up after we met.

1514
01:26:47,546 --> 01:26:52,005
Your death was so unremarkable and boring.

1515
01:26:52,671 --> 01:26:56,755
I can't remember the details,
apart from one thing.

1516
01:26:59,005 --> 01:27:00,755
You're gonna die alone.

1517
01:27:03,755 --> 01:27:04,796
Alone.

1518
01:27:05,296 --> 01:27:09,963
If you'll excuse me, Madam President.
I've got some work to do.

1519
01:27:10,046 --> 01:27:11,713
What the hell are you doing?

1520
01:27:11,796 --> 01:27:14,338
- My God.
- I was trying to do my job.

1521
01:27:14,421 --> 01:27:17,713
You are just so lucky
that Peter adores you.

1522
01:27:25,088 --> 01:27:27,380
You're with the grown-ups now, Randall.

1523
01:27:27,463 --> 01:27:29,088
I can't even follow this shit anymore!

1524
01:27:35,171 --> 01:27:40,380
BASH got Orlean to pay
the Chilean government, if I'm correct,

1525
01:27:40,463 --> 01:27:44,588
$90 billion to let the tsunami
hit off the coast of the country.

1526
01:27:44,671 --> 01:27:45,671
That sound right to you?

1527
01:27:45,755 --> 01:27:47,671
Isherwell built
an underground bunker

1528
01:27:47,755 --> 01:27:49,338
for him and all his executives.

1529
01:27:49,421 --> 01:27:51,796
No, I heard that
they built an escape ship.

1530
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:55,255
You guys,
the truth is way more depressing.

1531
01:27:56,296 --> 01:28:00,213
They're not even smart enough to be
as evil as you're giving them credit for.

1532
01:28:05,963 --> 01:28:06,838
Ugh!

1533
01:28:06,921 --> 01:28:08,546
- What?
- No.

1534
01:28:12,921 --> 01:28:16,130
Fuck! You're driving me fucking
crazy, Kate.

1535
01:28:16,213 --> 01:28:17,838
Fuck it. We're all gonna die.

Tell me about it.
And my friend Farley, he saw it.

1553
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:04,630
- He said it's a ton of fun. That's right.
- Well, Farley likes it.

1554
01:29:04,713 --> 01:29:07,255
All right, well, what Farley says goes.

1555
01:29:07,338 --> 01:29:08,588
<i>But, uh, first,</i>

1556
01:29:09,421 --> 01:29:12,463
and yes, you can tell from my smile...

1557
01:29:12,546 --> 01:29:13,838
Stop it.

1558
01:29:13,921 --> 01:29:18,921
That America's sexiest scientist is here.
Dr. Randall. Welcome.

1559
01:29:19,671 --> 01:29:21,380
Dr. Randall, how are you, sir?

1560
01:29:21,463 --> 01:29:24,213
I'm... I'm good.
I'm gooder than good.

1561
01:29:25,671 --> 01:29:30,838
All right. So, Randall, we're hearing
that there is no comet,

1562
01:29:30,921 --> 01:29:34,380
or that there is a comet but it's
a good thing or maybe it's a bad thing.

1563
01:29:34,463 --> 01:29:36,755
<i>We are so confused.</i>

1564
01:29:36,838 --> 01:29:41,171
So, could you please help us out here,
you know, oh, wise scientist?

1565
01:29:42,546 --> 01:29:45,421
Well, first and foremost, Brie, um...

1566
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:47,838
...there most certainly
is a comet.

1567
01:29:47,921 --> 01:29:48,796
All right.

1568
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:52,130
And we know that there is a comet
because we have the data.

1569
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:54,421
Um...

1570
01:29:54,505 --> 01:29:58,671
There has been growing concern within
the scientific community as of late.

1571
01:29:59,338 --> 01:30:02,880
You see, the peer-review process
is absolutely essential...

1572
01:30:02,963 --> 01:30:05,588
- If BASH's stock...
- ...for us to get to the facts of... Yes?

1573
01:30:05,671 --> 01:30:07,338
If BASH's stock is any indicator,

1574
01:30:07,421 --> 01:30:09,338
we don't have to worry
about the peer review.

1575
01:30:09,421 --> 01:30:10,588
It is going gangbusters.

1576
01:30:10,671 --> 01:30:13,130
And full disclosure.
I bought as many shares as I could.

1577
01:30:13,213 --> 01:30:14,505
I advise you to do the same.

1578
01:30:14,588 --> 01:30:16,338
You are such a shameless capitalist.

1579
01:30:16,421 --> 01:30:19,463
Said the woman who will be
in the brand-new hot tub on my back deck

1580
01:30:19,546 --> 01:30:22,088
- when I put it in from the stock.
- You know me too well.

1581
01:30:22,171 --> 01:30:23,213
That's right.

1582
01:30:23,296 --> 01:30:25,880
Dr. Randall, you sure you're okay?
You want a glass of water...

1583
01:30:25,963 --> 01:30:27,171
I don't feel so good.

1584
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:29,630
So I think we'll go
to commercial break...

1585
01:30:29,713 --> 01:30:33,296
No, Please, Brie. Don't cut away.
Let me say something.

1586
01:30:33,380 --> 01:30:34,921
- Okay.
- You came to the right place.

1587
01:30:35,005 --> 01:30:36,380
We like to say things.

1588
01:30:36,463 --> 01:30:40,421
Would you please
just stop being so pleasant?

1589
01:30:41,838 --> 01:30:44,796
I'm sorry, but not everything
needs to sound so goddamn clever

1590
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:47,088
or charming or likeable all the time.

1591
01:30:47,171 --> 01:30:50,588
Sometimes we need to just be able
to say things to one another.

1592
01:30:50,671 --> 01:30:52,088
We need to hear things.

1593
01:30:53,838 --> 01:30:57,130
Look, let's establish, once again,

1594
01:30:57,796 --> 01:31:01,921
that there is a huge comet
headed towards Earth.

1595
01:31:02,671 --> 01:31:05,296
And the reason we know
that there is a comet

1596
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:06,838
is because we saw it.

1597
01:31:06,921 --> 01:31:10,213
We saw it with our own eyes
using a telescope.

1598
01:31:10,296 --> 01:31:13,505
I mean, for God's sake,
we took a fucking picture of it!

1599
01:31:13,588 --> 01:31:15,296
What other proof do we need?

1600
01:31:15,796 --> 01:31:18,380
And if we can't all agree
at the bare minimum

1601
01:31:18,463 --> 01:31:22,880
that a giant comet
the size of Mount Everest

1602
01:31:22,963 --> 01:31:29,046
hurtling its way towards planet Earth
is not a fucking good thing,

1603
01:31:29,838 --> 01:31:32,130
then what the hell happened to us?

1604
01:31:33,005 --> 01:31:37,338
I mean, my God, how do...
How do we even talk to each other?

1605
01:31:37,421 --> 01:31:41,213
What've we... What've we done to ourselves?
How do we fix it?

1606
01:31:41,296 --> 01:31:44,796
We should have deflected this comet
when we had the fucking chance,

1607
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:48,088
but we didn't do it.
I don't know why we didn't do it.

1608
01:31:48,171 --> 01:31:51,963
And now they're
actually firing scientists like me

1609
01:31:52,046 --> 01:31:54,671
for speaking out, for opposing them.

1610
01:31:55,421 --> 01:31:57,880
And I'm sure many of the people out there

1611
01:31:57,963 --> 01:31:59,963
aren't even
gonna listen to what I just said

1612
01:32:00,046 --> 01:32:02,838
'cause they have
their own political ideology,

1613
01:32:03,505 --> 01:32:05,921
but I... assure you,

1614
01:32:06,588 --> 01:32:08,588
I am not on one side or the other.

1615
01:32:08,671 --> 01:32:10,921
I'm just telling you the fucking truth.

1616
01:32:11,005 --> 01:32:12,630
This would be a good time to establish

1617
01:32:12,713 --> 01:32:15,255
that Isherwell and the president
have both said

1618
01:32:15,338 --> 01:32:16,963
that there's benefits to be...

1619
01:32:17,046 --> 01:32:21,755
Right, well, the president
of the United States is fucking lying!

1620
01:32:23,130 --> 01:32:24,713
Look, I'm just like all of you.

1621
01:32:24,796 --> 01:32:29,838
I hope to God, I hope to <i>God</i> that
this president knows what she's doing.

1622
01:32:29,921 --> 01:32:33,755
I hope she's got us all taken care of,
but the truth is,

1623
01:32:33,838 --> 01:32:36,880
I think this whole administration

1624
01:32:36,963 --> 01:32:41,505
has completely lost their fucking mind!

1625
01:32:41,588 --> 01:32:45,130
And I think we're all gonna die!

1626
01:32:49,296 --> 01:32:51,130
Look, I just wanna go home.

1627
01:32:51,796 --> 01:32:54,130
I just wanna go home.

1628
01:32:54,213 --> 01:32:56,130
I just wanna go home more than anything.

1629
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:02,588
But if there is one thing,

1630
01:33:03,213 --> 01:33:05,296
one thing that I pray...

1631
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:09,838
that I pray that all of you hear
from what I have just said,

1632
01:33:10,630 --> 01:33:13,588
is that all of us, all of us...

1633
01:33:22,088 --> 01:33:23,630
Why'd you do that?

1634
01:33:24,755 --> 01:33:28,255
I really liked you
and I despise most people.

1635
01:33:29,796 --> 01:33:33,005
You know, I...
I really thought I loved you.

1636
01:33:35,796 --> 01:33:36,963
Really?

1637
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:38,880
Wow.

1638
01:33:40,380 --> 01:33:41,838
That's wild.

1639
01:33:43,005 --> 01:33:44,630
Yeah.

1640
01:33:44,713 --> 01:33:47,421
Ma'am, you need to go.
We gotta get this man off the grid.

1641
01:33:49,505 --> 01:33:50,713
You still there?

1642
01:33:53,755 --> 01:33:54,796
No.

1643
01:33:57,296 --> 01:34:01,046
Well, maybe he just gets off
on the power, you know,

1644
01:34:01,130 --> 01:34:02,796
like any kind of power.

1645
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:07,755
It's like he knew eventually that I was
gonna find out that the snacks were free.

1646
01:34:07,838 --> 01:34:09,296
- Right.
- You know what I mean?

1647
01:34:09,380 --> 01:34:11,838
- Yeah.
- So it was just like a power play.

1648
01:34:12,546 --> 01:34:13,630
Yeah, guys are weird.

1649
01:34:16,255 --> 01:34:20,005
I'm starting to think that all this
"end of the world" stuff is bullshit.

1650
01:34:21,630 --> 01:34:22,838
It's not.

1651
01:34:22,921 --> 01:34:26,838
It's definitely happening. I've seen it.

1652
01:34:27,421 --> 01:34:31,046
I feel like if God wanted to destroy
the Earth, He would destroy the Earth.

1653
01:34:33,338 --> 01:34:34,588
You believe in God?

1654
01:34:36,546 --> 01:34:39,171
Yeah, I mean,
my parents raised me Evangelical,

1655
01:34:39,255 --> 01:34:41,588
and I hate them,
but I found my own way to it.

1656
01:34:41,671 --> 01:34:42,921
My own relationship.

1657
01:34:44,338 --> 01:34:45,463
Hmm.

1658
01:34:46,421 --> 01:34:48,713
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't advertise it, though.

1659
01:34:52,046 --> 01:34:55,171
I won't tell anybody.
I think it's kind of sweet.

1660
01:34:58,755 --> 01:35:01,338
- Wanna make out?
- Yeah, why not?

1661
01:35:02,463 --> 01:35:05,463
Can you not say "why not"?
It makes me feel like you don't want it.

1662
01:35:06,463 --> 01:35:07,463
It's shitty.

1663
01:35:09,546 --> 01:35:12,171
- Sure, whatever.
- That's better.

01:36:10,505 --> 01:36:11,505
What?

1676
01:36:13,755 --> 01:36:14,588
Come on.

1677
01:36:22,213 --> 01:36:23,213
There it is.

1678
01:36:25,963 --> 01:36:27,130
There you are.

1679
01:36:30,171 --> 01:36:31,171
There you are.

1680
01:36:32,088 --> 01:36:34,255
Is anyone else seeing this? That's it.

1681
01:36:35,046 --> 01:36:38,838
That's it. That's the comet.
Look! It's right there.

1682
01:37:16,338 --> 01:37:19,296
- That's, you know, kinda scary.
- Oh! Exactly.

1683
01:37:23,796 --> 01:37:25,630
- Dr. Mindy.
<i>- Kate.</i>

1684
01:37:25,713 --> 01:37:27,880
Doc, you can see it.

1685
01:37:27,963 --> 01:37:32,171
I... I'm looking at it right now too.
It's unbelievable. It's...

1686
01:37:32,671 --> 01:37:36,255
It's horrific and it's...
And it's beautiful at the same time.

1687
01:37:36,338 --> 01:37:38,046
Oh, my God.

1688
01:37:43,213 --> 01:37:45,130
We've been trying to tell you.

1689
01:37:45,755 --> 01:37:49,046
We tried to tell you this whole time.
It's right there. It's...

1690
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:51,463
It's right there, Kate.

1691
01:37:54,296 --> 01:37:55,380
<i>Where are you?</i>

1692
01:37:55,463 --> 01:37:56,880
I'm in Lansing, Michigan

1693
01:37:56,963 --> 01:38:00,130
<i>trying to fix things with June,
but she won't talk to me.</i>

1694
01:38:00,213 --> 01:38:02,088
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- What the fuck?

1695
01:38:03,046 --> 01:38:04,171
I...

1696
01:38:04,255 --> 01:38:06,296
<i>I'm gonna come find you, okay?</i>

1697
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:10,713
Well, I'm in Illinois.
I could be ready by tomorrow.

1698
01:38:12,088 --> 01:38:13,408
- Dearest Father...
- Yeah, I'm...

1699
01:38:13,463 --> 01:38:16,005
...as a sinner I come to You
for Your grace and guidance...

1700
01:38:16,088 --> 01:38:18,130
<i>They're finally seeing it.</i>

1701
01:38:18,713 --> 01:38:20,255
They're finally seeing it.

1702
01:38:26,088 --> 01:38:27,588
There it is!

1703
01:38:41,630 --> 01:38:45,213
Go outside into your yard,
onto a roof, onto your sidewalk,

1704
01:38:45,296 --> 01:38:46,713
and just look up into the sky.

1705
01:38:46,796 --> 01:38:50,130
The star's gonna appear fuzzy.
It's got a long streak coming off of it.

1706
01:38:50,213 --> 01:38:51,713
That's the comet's tail.

1707
01:38:51,796 --> 01:38:53,380
<i>It's real and it's coming.</i>

1708
01:38:53,463 --> 01:38:56,046
<i>If anyone tells you any different,
they're full of shit.</i>

1709
01:38:56,130 --> 01:38:57,630
<i>Just look up into the sky.</i>

1710
01:38:57,713 --> 01:38:59,171
<i>It's a fucking fact.</i>

1711
01:38:59,255 --> 01:39:00,713
<i>- We have proof.
- Just look up.</i>

1712
01:39:00,796 --> 01:39:04,421
<i>Guys, please just look up, okay?
Screw the manatees and just look up.</i>

1713
01:39:04,505 --> 01:39:05,505
<i>Just look up.</i>

1714
01:39:05,546 --> 01:39:07,630
- <i>Just look up!
- Just look up! Just look up!</i>

1715
01:39:07,713 --> 01:39:08,713
<i>Just look up!</i>

1716
01:39:08,796 --> 01:39:13,088
<i>Dr. Mindy, the president's
plan to save Earth</i>

1717
01:39:13,171 --> 01:39:18,130
<i>and make it so we can all have a home
is going to work, right?</i>

1718
01:39:18,213 --> 01:39:22,255
<i>Every single man, woman and child
on this planet is going to die.</i>

1719
01:39:22,338 --> 01:39:25,546
<i>- I don't like him. He makes me sad.
- I'm sorry about that.</i>

1720
01:39:25,630 --> 01:39:27,630
<i>- This is not what we rehearsed.
- Kids, listen.</i>

1721
01:39:27,713 --> 01:39:30,880
You tell your parents
that President Orlean and Isherwell

1722
01:39:30,963 --> 01:39:32,630
are sociopaths and fascists!

1723
01:39:39,796 --> 01:39:42,713
And do you know why
they want you to look up?

1724
01:39:43,671 --> 01:39:45,421
Do you know why?

1725
01:39:45,505 --> 01:39:48,046
'Cause they want you to be afraid.

1726
01:39:49,505 --> 01:39:51,963
They want you to look up

1727
01:39:52,046 --> 01:39:54,713
because they are
looking down their noses at you.

1728
01:39:56,046 --> 01:39:57,921
<i>They think they're better than you.</i>

1729
01:39:58,005 --> 01:40:00,505
<i>Don't look up!</i>

1730
01:40:00,588 --> 01:40:02,838
<i>They wanna rob you of your freedom,
and that's a fact!</i>

1731
01:40:02,921 --> 01:40:05,005
<i>Don't look up!</i>

1732
01:40:05,088 --> 01:40:06,838
<i>The US president, Orlean...</i>

1733
01:40:06,921 --> 01:40:09,255
<i>Just look up!</i>

1734
01:40:09,338 --> 01:40:12,630
<i>...has not included India
or any other nation in the world</i>

1735
01:40:12,713 --> 01:40:14,046
<i>to be a part of this mission.</i>

1736
01:40:14,755 --> 01:40:17,380
<i>This dude is a known pornographer
named Kip...</i>

1737
01:40:17,463 --> 01:40:18,713
<i>Don't listen to that dumbfuck.</i>

1738
01:40:18,796 --> 01:40:24,796
<i>The United Nations have been
considering its own deflective mission.</i>

1739
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,130
<i>Just look up, for fuck's sake!</i>

1740
01:40:27,213 --> 01:40:30,963
Now I know a lot of Hollywood
is supporting the Just Look Up movement,

1741
01:40:31,046 --> 01:40:32,880
but I haven't seen a pin like that.

1742
01:40:32,963 --> 01:40:37,713
Yeah, this pin points both up and down.

1743
01:40:38,296 --> 01:40:42,921
Because I think, as a country,
we need to stop arguing

1744
01:40:43,005 --> 01:40:45,505
and virtue signaling. Just get along.

1745
01:40:46,130 --> 01:40:48,505
- That is so refreshing.
- Hmm.

1746
01:40:48,588 --> 01:40:51,213
I think
we're all tired of the politics.

1747
01:40:51,296 --> 01:40:53,463
Yeah, yeah. Well...

1748
01:40:54,463 --> 01:40:56,088
That's why we made <i>Total Devastation.</i>

1749
01:40:56,171 --> 01:40:58,296
It's for everyone. You know?
It's a popcorn movie.

1750
01:40:58,380 --> 01:41:02,088
You keep your eye on the road ahead,
you put your head down.

1751
01:41:02,171 --> 01:41:04,588
And you put
one foot in front of the other,

1752
01:41:04,671 --> 01:41:05,713
step by step.

1753
01:41:07,005 --> 01:41:08,088
<i>Day by day.</i>

1754
01:41:08,171 --> 01:41:11,380
- Don't look up!
- Don't!

1755
01:41:17,463 --> 01:41:20,505
So we wanna say something loud and clear.

1756
01:41:20,588 --> 01:41:24,213
There is no safe way
to bring this comet back to Earth

1757
01:41:24,296 --> 01:41:27,005
and exploit it for profit.
It cannot be done!

1758
01:41:27,588 --> 01:41:31,463
Nations of the world,
defy Orlean and BASH!

1759
01:41:31,546 --> 01:41:36,088
Launch your own nuclear deflection mission
now and save this planet!

1760
01:41:37,546 --> 01:41:43,380
And now, uh, there's Riley Bina
with her special guest.

1761
01:41:43,463 --> 01:41:45,713
I forgot the name. Thank you.

1781
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:28,546

Oh.

1814
01:45:20,546 --> 01:45:23,838
Hey, good afternoon, Adam.
What do I owe the pleasure of this call?

1815
01:45:30,046 --> 01:45:31,046
What time?

1816
01:45:38,796 --> 01:45:41,713
Well, uh... Well, thank you for calling.

1817
01:45:41,796 --> 01:45:42,796
Um...

1818
01:45:44,130 --> 01:45:45,130
Yeah.

1819
01:46:01,588 --> 01:46:02,588
What?

1820
01:46:05,963 --> 01:46:06,963
What?

1821
01:46:09,921 --> 01:46:14,713
Orlean and BASH
cut Russia, India, and China

1822
01:46:15,963 --> 01:46:17,380
out of the rights for the minerals.

1823
01:46:17,463 --> 01:46:20,921
So they tried their own
joint deflection mission,

1824
01:46:21,005 --> 01:46:25,713
but, uh... approximately 40 minutes ago,

1825
01:46:26,588 --> 01:46:33,005
there was a massive explosion detected
at the Russian's Baikonur launch complex.

1826
01:46:35,463 --> 01:46:37,671
So it looks like the mission failed.

1827
01:46:42,796 --> 01:46:44,005
That's it?

1828
01:46:47,088 --> 01:46:48,671
What do you mean, "that's it?"

1829
01:46:52,088 --> 01:46:53,130
Teddy?

1830
01:46:56,463 --> 01:46:57,463
Right?

1831
01:47:03,171 --> 01:47:07,005
There is still the BASH mission.
It's all we have now.

1832
01:47:14,088 --> 01:47:15,088
Fuck!

1833
01:47:27,296 --> 01:47:30,088
These Just Look Uppers

1834
01:47:30,171 --> 01:47:35,838
want millions of illegal Chileans
to come across the border.

1835
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:40,296
Don't look up.

1836
01:47:44,546 --> 01:47:46,296
The hell is that?

1837
01:47:52,421 --> 01:47:54,588
Fucking lied to us.

1838
01:47:56,130 --> 01:47:59,046
The president just texted me.

1839
01:47:59,130 --> 01:48:02,588
"Don't trip. It's all good. Don't trip."

1840
01:48:05,005 --> 01:48:06,005
Hey, now.

1841
01:48:06,588 --> 01:48:09,255
You cut my face, you fucking rednecks!

1842
01:48:22,046 --> 01:48:24,380
Man, there hasn't been
a car in, like, an hour.

1843
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:28,546
Yep.
Everyone's watching the BASH launch.

1844
01:48:31,046 --> 01:48:32,338
What are we doing again?

1845
01:48:35,005 --> 01:48:39,421
I told you. We're, uh...
We're gonna go buy some groceries.

1846
01:48:48,046 --> 01:48:53,255
The Mills Brothers. Great band.
You know, Duke Ellington found this band.

1847
01:48:55,963 --> 01:49:00,005
I think they were originally called
the Four Kings of Harmony.

1848
01:49:01,546 --> 01:49:05,671
<i>♪ We'll call on each memory
Till then... ♪</i>

1849
01:49:05,755 --> 01:49:08,213
"Till Then," this is the song.
It's about, uh...

1850
01:49:09,213 --> 01:49:11,463
It's about soldiers
going off to World War II

1851
01:49:11,546 --> 01:49:13,380
and thinking about home.

1852
01:49:16,630 --> 01:49:17,713
Listen to this part.

1853
01:49:17,796 --> 01:49:20,963
<i>♪ Although there are oceans... ♪</i>

1854
01:49:21,046 --> 01:49:27,046
"Although there are oceans we must cross
and mountains that we must climb..."

1855
01:49:28,546 --> 01:49:31,546
<i>♪ I know every gain... ♪</i>

1856
01:49:31,630 --> 01:49:34,713

<i>♪ So pray that our loss... ♪</i>

1858
01:49:36,713 --> 01:49:40,713
"So pray that our loss

1860
01:49:46,546 --> 01:49:49,088
- Okay, I gotta ask you something.
- What?

1861
01:49:51,671 --> 01:49:53,671
Dr. Mindy, can I be vulnerable
in your car?

1862
01:49:53,755 --> 01:49:55,130
Yeah, go ahead.

1863
01:49:57,088 --> 01:49:58,880
I've never met anyone like you

1864
01:49:58,963 --> 01:50:01,171
and I feel a connection to you
on a level that...

1865
01:50:04,338 --> 01:50:06,255
I don't know,
I haven't felt with anyone else,

1866
01:50:06,338 --> 01:50:08,380
and going out on a limb,

1867
01:50:08,463 --> 01:50:10,463
but would you want to spend
more time together?

1868
01:50:10,546 --> 01:50:14,963
Maybe even get engaged or something?

1869
01:50:16,171 --> 01:50:18,005
- Wow.
- Are you laughing?

1870
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,130
- No?
- I'm smiling.

1871
01:50:21,546 --> 01:50:23,546
- Well, sure.
- This is sweet.

1872
01:50:23,630 --> 01:50:26,880
- Why not?
- This is pretty sweet.

1873
01:50:37,296 --> 01:50:41,796
And you read
the tea leaves for Dr. Mindy.

1874
01:50:41,880 --> 01:50:43,880
- You showed him the algorithm.
- Oh, yeah.

1875
01:50:43,963 --> 01:50:46,046
You really shook him
with that information.

1876
01:50:46,130 --> 01:50:48,921
- How he was gonna die.
- Yeah, it is shaking.

1877
01:50:49,630 --> 01:50:51,921
It got me so excited
to know about my own death.

1878
01:50:54,588 --> 01:50:57,213
I don't think I wanna know.
Yes, I do. I wanna to know.

1879
01:50:57,296 --> 01:51:01,546
You're gonna be eaten by a Bronteroc.
We don't know what it means.

1880
01:51:01,630 --> 01:51:03,588
- A what?
- A Bronteroc.

1881
01:51:05,213 --> 01:51:07,713
- Oh.
- Okay, people, we have clear skies.

1882
01:51:09,546 --> 01:51:12,755
And we are a go for the BEAD launch.

1883
01:51:12,838 --> 01:51:13,963
Madam President?

1884
01:51:14,046 --> 01:51:18,588
Citizens of planet Earth. Now...

1885
01:51:19,546 --> 01:51:23,255
Look at this, Kate. They have wild salmon.

1886
01:51:23,338 --> 01:51:26,421
Look at the difference between that
and the farm-raised stuff.

1887
01:51:26,505 --> 01:51:29,713
You see how that looks just...
I don't know. Looks fake, right?

1888
01:51:30,838 --> 01:51:33,380
Hey, why don't you go find some, uh...

1889
01:51:33,463 --> 01:51:35,963
What are the little potatoes called,
the tiny ones?

1890
01:51:36,046 --> 01:51:37,206
- Fingerling potatoes?
- Yeah.

1891
01:51:37,255 --> 01:51:39,755
- I fucking love fingerling potatoes.
- Let's get finger...

1892
01:51:39,838 --> 01:51:41,338
Do you wanna say something too?

1893
01:51:41,421 --> 01:51:42,713
That was beautiful. Yeah.

1894
01:51:43,671 --> 01:51:47,796
What up, world? Jason Orlean,
uh, Chief of Staff, United States.

1895
01:51:47,880 --> 01:51:48,880
Um...

1896
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:53,463
I've been noticing a lot of prayers
recently for people during this time

1897
01:51:54,296 --> 01:51:55,755
and I commend that, um,

1898
01:51:55,838 --> 01:52:02,130
but I also wanna give a prayer for stuff.

1899
01:52:03,630 --> 01:52:08,921
There's dope stuff, like material stuff,
like sick apartments and watches,

1900
01:52:09,005 --> 01:52:11,755
<i>and cars, um, and clothes and shit</i>

1901
01:52:11,838 --> 01:52:16,421
<i>that could all go away
and I don't wanna see that stuff go away.</i>

1902
01:52:16,505 --> 01:52:18,838
So I'm gonna say a prayer
for that stuff. Amen.

1903
01:52:21,963 --> 01:52:25,046
<i>Just a quiet trepidation
among this much smaller crowd.</i>

1904
01:52:25,130 --> 01:52:27,005
<i>I can hear the sounds
of some people praying.</i>

1905
01:52:27,088 --> 01:52:29,171
Okay, Anderson, let's go get it.

1906
01:52:29,255 --> 01:52:32,505
Yes, sir. Here we go, people.

1907
01:52:33,296 --> 01:52:34,130
Ten.

1908
01:52:34,213 --> 01:52:41,130
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,</i>

1909
01:52:41,838 --> 01:52:43,880
<i>five, four...</i>

1910
01:53:02,671 --> 01:53:03,671
Hey.

1911
01:53:04,963 --> 01:53:05,796
Hi.

1912
01:53:16,588 --> 01:53:19,546
We, uh, got some groceries.

1913
01:53:28,921 --> 01:53:30,296
Yo, what was that?

1914
01:53:30,380 --> 01:53:32,296
We lost BEAD number 12.

1915
01:53:35,213 --> 01:53:36,838
BEAD number 22 failed to launch.

1916
01:53:37,713 --> 01:53:40,546
It's fine. It's fine.

1917
01:53:40,630 --> 01:53:44,671
We had anticipated a margin for error.

1918
01:53:44,755 --> 01:53:46,255
Everything is fine.

1919
01:53:46,338 --> 01:53:50,838
I was hoping
we could, um, have a family dinner.

1920
01:53:50,921 --> 01:53:52,296
Hey, Dad.

1921
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:54,463
- Hey, guys. Hey.
- Hey.

1922
01:54:00,838 --> 01:54:01,838
What do you say?

1923
01:54:04,171 --> 01:54:05,171
Yeah.

1924
01:54:05,921 --> 01:54:07,296
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1925
01:54:07,796 --> 01:54:10,005
- This is, uh... This is Kate.
- Oh, hi.

1926
01:54:10,088 --> 01:54:11,921
- Hello. Hi, Kate.
- Let me grab those bags.

1927
01:54:12,005 --> 01:54:13,755
- Nice to meet you. I'm Yule.
- Yule.

1928
01:54:13,838 --> 01:54:16,005
I'm FirePuma142 on Twitch. You game?

1929
01:54:16,630 --> 01:54:18,130
It's really doubtful she knows.

1930
01:54:18,213 --> 01:54:19,838
- You're right.
- Who said I game?

1931
01:54:21,005 --> 01:54:23,338
I... I got these for you.

1932
01:54:25,213 --> 01:54:27,171
Thank you. That's really sweet, honey.

1933
01:54:33,380 --> 01:54:35,380
I'm so sorry. You have no idea.

1934
01:54:37,213 --> 01:54:39,921
- I really am.
- I know. I know.

1935
01:54:40,755 --> 01:54:43,880
- I've missed you.
- I missed you so much.

1936
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:53,630
When we dated in college,
I fucked Aaron Tran.

1937
01:54:55,880 --> 01:54:56,880
Oh?

1938
01:54:57,338 --> 01:54:58,713
Yeah, so, uh...

1939
01:55:14,546 --> 01:55:16,838
- That is really good.
- Really good, right?

1940
01:55:27,713 --> 01:55:30,005
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey!

1941
01:55:30,088 --> 01:55:32,796
- Sorry I'm late, but not empty-handed.
- Hey, my friend.

1942
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:37,380
Evan, Marshall, June,
this is Dr. Oglethorpe.

1943
01:55:52,005 --> 01:55:54,880
BEADs have approached
optimal escape velocity

1944
01:55:54,963 --> 01:55:59,630
and now approaching Comet Dibiasky
and are ready for attachment mode.

1945
01:56:15,005 --> 01:56:17,630
Uh... Okay. All right.

1946
01:56:17,713 --> 01:56:20,838
Eight and 27 are lost
due to lateral control malfunction.

1947
01:56:21,755 --> 01:56:24,671
Okay, so, now... Now, Peter...

1948
01:56:24,755 --> 01:56:28,963
Peter, we're six drones down.
Is this thing still gonna work?

1949
01:56:29,046 --> 01:56:34,880
Well, the engineer's assured me
that yes, 24 drones is enough.

1950
01:56:35,963 --> 01:56:38,963
Well, how many can we lose?

1951
01:56:41,588 --> 01:56:43,088
How many more?

1952
01:56:46,630 --> 01:56:50,255
<i>We're being told that several
of the BEADS have exploded on launch.</i>

1953
01:56:51,296 --> 01:56:54,130
Got the head seat right there.

1954
01:56:54,213 --> 01:56:56,796
You're way too kind, Randall. Thank you.

1955
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:57,880
Big Doctor.

1956
01:56:57,963 --> 01:56:59,171
Do you want more wine?

1957
01:57:00,296 --> 01:57:02,336
- Hey, cheers, everyone. Huh?
- Cheers.

1958
01:57:02,380 --> 01:57:03,481
- Cheers.
- Love you.

1959
01:57:03,505 --> 01:57:05,305
- Love you.
- Thank you so much for having us.

1960
01:57:05,338 --> 01:57:06,588
Thank you for being here.

1961
01:57:06,671 --> 01:57:08,213
- It's so special.
- Thank you.

1962
01:57:20,963 --> 01:57:24,171
Commence simultaneous
explosive separation stage now.

1963
01:57:27,546 --> 01:57:29,713
Yo. Yo. Mom.

1964
01:57:39,713 --> 01:57:40,755
Beautiful.

1965
01:57:41,338 --> 01:57:43,255
- Thank you, pal.
- Yeah.

1966
01:57:43,338 --> 01:57:48,088
Yeah, it really is.
And it's really good to have you home.

1967
01:57:49,755 --> 01:57:51,505
Dr. Mindy got really famous.

1968
01:57:51,588 --> 01:57:54,130
Oh. Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

1969
01:57:54,213 --> 01:57:55,796
That's right. Okay.

1970
01:57:56,713 --> 01:58:00,630
Yep, I was on, uh, magazine covers
and everything. I know.

1971
01:58:01,296 --> 01:58:03,380
- You looked great.
- I'll take your shots.

1972
01:58:07,838 --> 01:58:09,478
- I love you.
- Love you too.

1973
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:13,505
All right. We need a report.

1974
01:58:13,588 --> 01:58:16,171
Need a full status report
on the explosive devices.

1975
01:58:16,255 --> 01:58:19,421
Get on it.
Still waiting for a full status report.

1976
01:58:21,421 --> 01:58:22,463
All right.

1977
01:58:22,546 --> 01:58:27,630
President Qi of China
says that the comet is still whole.

1978
01:58:27,713 --> 01:58:29,796
We got four misfires and sync was off.

1979
01:58:30,630 --> 01:58:31,630
It's still intact.

1980
01:58:31,713 --> 01:58:32,880
What was that?

1981
01:58:33,546 --> 01:58:35,963
We've got four misfires
and the sync was off.

1982
01:58:36,796 --> 01:58:40,963
Okay. We're all fine. Everyone's fine.

1983
01:58:41,713 --> 01:58:44,796
It's gonna be all right.
If you'll excuse me.

1984
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:46,130
Nature calls.

1985
01:58:46,213 --> 01:58:49,213
I'm just gonna go to the restroom
for a moment.

1986
01:58:52,671 --> 01:58:55,546
Yes, uh, I think
that I should also step out

1987
01:58:55,630 --> 01:58:57,338
to the restroom for a moment.

1988
01:59:03,588 --> 01:59:05,588
- Should I...
- No, I'll be fine.

1989
01:59:06,630 --> 01:59:08,130
Sir, the president.

1990
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:11,005
We need to know
what the mission status is.

1991
01:59:13,171 --> 01:59:14,755
She's coming right back.

1992
01:59:15,421 --> 01:59:18,046
Screw this. I'm going to see my husband.

1993
01:59:21,338 --> 01:59:24,630
I'm sorry. I've got a 20-year-old
daughter. I've got to go see her.

1994
01:59:25,296 --> 01:59:26,630
I'm doin' an 8-ball.

1995
01:59:27,796 --> 01:59:28,838
Oh, shit!

1996
01:59:28,921 --> 01:59:30,630
She's coming. She's coming back.

1997
01:59:37,046 --> 01:59:39,255
Hello, there's a ship.

1998
01:59:39,796 --> 01:59:43,921
In case we were wrong,
and clearly, we were wrong.

1999
01:59:44,005 --> 01:59:46,463
Of course you've got a ship.

2000
01:59:46,546 --> 01:59:48,130
<i>It holds 2,000.</i>

2001
01:59:48,213 --> 01:59:51,463
It's state-of-the-art cryo-chambers,
and it's set to find

2002
01:59:51,546 --> 01:59:54,671
the nearest Earth-like planet
in a Goldilocks Zone so...

2003
01:59:54,755 --> 01:59:55,630
Hmm.

2004
01:59:55,713 --> 01:59:57,130
<i>There's room for you and one other.</i>

2005
01:59:58,171 --> 02:00:00,255
Brie, your wife, your call.

2006
02:00:02,713 --> 02:00:09,505
I'm good, but thank you for the offer.
You, uh... You have fun with Jason.

2007
02:00:11,546 --> 02:00:12,546
Jason?

2008
02:00:15,255 --> 02:00:16,380
Oh, shit.

2009
02:00:20,088 --> 02:00:21,088
She's coming back.

2010
02:00:30,130 --> 02:00:33,046
I'm thankful for that night
I fell asleep out in the backyard.

2011
02:00:33,796 --> 02:00:36,171
- Woke up face-to-face with a baby deer.
- I remember that.

2012
02:00:36,255 --> 02:00:38,713
- Yeah.
- Yep. It was the best day of my life.

2013
02:00:50,171 --> 02:00:51,380
I'm grateful...

2014
02:00:58,755 --> 02:01:00,671
I'm grateful we tried.

2015
02:01:03,546 --> 02:01:06,005
Man, oh, man, did we try.

2016
02:01:08,463 --> 02:01:13,796
Well, we're not the most religious here
in the Mindy household,

2017
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:17,505
but, um, maybe we should say "amen"?
Should we do that?

2018
02:01:17,588 --> 02:01:19,046
Don't look at me.

2019
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:23,838
I don't know how to...
What, you just say, "Amen"? I don't...

2020
02:01:24,546 --> 02:01:25,755
- I got this.
- Wrap it up?

2021
02:01:26,421 --> 02:01:27,421
I got it.

2022
02:01:38,755 --> 02:01:41,005
Dearest Father and Almighty Creator...

2023
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:48,713
...we ask for Your grace tonight,
despite our pride.

2024
02:01:50,421 --> 02:01:54,296
Your forgiveness, despite our doubt.

2025
02:01:57,630 --> 02:01:59,130
Most of all, Lord...

2026
02:02:01,130 --> 02:02:05,796
we ask for Your love
to soothe us through these dark times.

2027
02:02:08,296 --> 02:02:10,505
May we face whatever is to come...

2028
02:02:12,796 --> 02:02:18,588
<i>...in Your divine will with courage
and open hearts of acceptance.</i>

2029
02:02:21,838 --> 02:02:24,296
- Amen.
- Amen.

2030
02:02:25,546 --> 02:02:27,713
Wow. Youse got some church game.

2031
02:02:29,630 --> 02:02:30,755
That was beautiful.

2032
02:02:34,171 --> 02:02:36,130
The comet remains intact.

2033
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:44,546
We just never...

2034
02:02:46,755 --> 02:02:50,213
Of course, there's only one story
everyone's talking about tonight.

2035
02:02:50,796 --> 02:02:52,796
<i>Topless urgent care centers.</i>

2036
02:03:03,005 --> 02:03:04,463
Sit.

2037
02:03:06,463 --> 02:03:10,796
Or... we can fuck...

2038
02:03:12,838 --> 02:03:14,671
...or pray, or...

2039
02:03:18,796 --> 02:03:22,296
Honestly, I think
I'd just rather drink and...

2040
02:03:24,255 --> 02:03:25,921
talk shit about people.

2041
02:03:32,213 --> 02:03:33,838
You'll never take me alive!

2042
02:03:37,046 --> 02:03:38,046
Look out!

2043
02:04:30,088 --> 02:04:32,921
I'm definitely gonna have
some more of this apple pie. It's so good.

2044
02:04:33,005 --> 02:04:35,796
It's actually store-bought,
but you really can't tell.

2045
02:04:37,671 --> 02:04:42,213
If I'm to be completely honest,
which at this moment, why not?

2046
02:04:43,213 --> 02:04:46,921
I actually like the junky taste
of store-bought better than homemade.

2047
02:04:47,671 --> 02:04:48,671
You gotta be kidding me.

2048
02:04:48,755 --> 02:04:52,171
No, I'm not kidding.

2049
02:04:53,463 --> 02:04:56,671
You know what? I know what he means.
It's like a childhood memory thing.

2050
02:05:31,671 --> 02:05:33,588
Nothing is better than homemade, right?

2051
02:05:33,671 --> 02:05:37,213
This coffee doesn't taste
store-bought. Is it?

2052
02:05:37,296 --> 02:05:39,671
I grind my own beans. Yeah.

2053
02:05:39,755 --> 02:05:41,380
Yeah, Dad's kind of a coffee nut.

2054
02:05:41,463 --> 02:05:43,713
Every time you have coffee,
you have to grind your beans?

2055
02:05:44,713 --> 02:05:48,671
Randall is very particular
about his coffee.

2056
02:05:48,755 --> 02:05:50,380
I can get that way about tea.

2057
02:05:53,213 --> 02:05:55,546
Thing of it is, we really...

2058
02:05:57,630 --> 02:05:59,838
We really did have everything, didn't we?

2059
02:06:02,088 --> 02:06:04,505

Hey, oxygen is
actually higher than on Earth

2080
02:09:40,005 --> 02:09:41,171
by nine percent,

2081
02:09:41,255 --> 02:09:43,838
so you might feel a bit light-headed.

2082
02:09:44,671 --> 02:09:48,213
And cryo-chambers were 58% successful,

2083
02:09:48,296 --> 02:09:50,588
which is much better than anticipated.

2084
02:09:50,671 --> 02:09:53,796
Yeah, we only had 47 dead
in our section, so...

2085
02:09:54,588 --> 02:09:59,005
I think this is gonna work out quite well.
Quite well, indeed.

2086
02:09:59,088 --> 02:09:59,921
Goodness.

2087
02:10:00,005 --> 02:10:05,630
Look at that beautiful animal.

2088
02:10:05,713 --> 02:10:09,713
I wonder, are those feathers
or are they scale...

2089
02:10:12,713 --> 02:10:14,963
- That's disgusting.
- What is that thing?

2090
02:10:15,671 --> 02:10:18,130
I believe that's called a Bronteroc.

2091
