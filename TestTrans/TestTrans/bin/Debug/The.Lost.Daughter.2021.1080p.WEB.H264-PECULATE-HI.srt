- [man] Was the drive all right?
- [Leda] Yeah.

9
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:31,333
[man] Must've been backed up
on the National Road after Corinth.

Have you been waiting a long time?

Is this your place?

17

No, I take care of it. For 30 years now.

[Leda] Oh, wow.

19
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,541

It's just, you're in the sun.
I could move your chair if you'd like.

Oh, yeah, I am in the sun.

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,625
I told the kids today.
You didn't have them the other day.

90
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,916
- You see that ice cream? That ice cream.
- That ice cream. Okay. Great.

91
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,041
No, but also like the rainbow colored.
You have that?

- Yeah.
- I told you.

93
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,916

[woman] Nina.

102
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,625
Nina, you gotta put something on her
'cause it's cold now.

103
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,125
That robe.

104
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,125
You gotta put something on her.

See? That's all better.

106
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:46,916

that I'm ever gonna get my doll?

- [young Leda] What?

138
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,833
[girl 1] We should stick
googly eyes on his face,

139
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:22,041

and decorate the cage.

- No, I'm fine here.

00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:33,000
- Cunt!
- [laughter]

178
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,833
Honestly, I don't even know
what to say to you.

179
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,250
It's just moving
down the beach a few feet.

180
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,791
- This fucking…
- That's enough.

181
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:42,625
I'm sorry.

182
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,875
[indistinct conversation]

183
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,666
[people on the beach singing]

184
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,250
We put you on a diet
and you're eating all this cake.

185
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,458
[speaks indistinctly]

186
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,625
- You want a piece of cake?
- Oh, thank you. No.

187
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,458
[woman] I'm sorry about earlier.
All right?

188
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,000
It's my birthday.

189
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,791
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

190
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,208
- How old are you?
- I'm 42.

191
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,458
[Leda] You got a lovely big belly.

192
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:37,208
Well, it's a girl. So, you know.

193
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,291
- And how much longer have you got?
- [woman] Two months.

194
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:44,000
My sister-in-law had hers right away.

195
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:45,916
Took me eight years.

196
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,333
These things happen
when they're supposed to happen.

197
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,125
- Have a great birthday.
- Where you from?

198
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:57,166
I'm from Cambridge, near Boston.

199
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,375
No, I mean, where are your people from?

200
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,333
- My people?
- Yeah.

201
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:07,083
Are from Leeds. Well, Shipley, really.

202
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,625
- Fancy.
- No, it's not fancy.

203
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:13,875
I thought you were from Queens. I swear.

204
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:17,500
Not 'cause you talk like it,
but just, like… something.

205
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:20,041
That's where we're mostly from,

206
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:23,125
but we have family
in this town for, like, 300 years.

207
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:24,375
Oh.

208
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,375
[woman] Uh…

209
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,166
You don't have kids?

210
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,458
Yes, I have two daughters.

211
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,625
[woman] Where are they?

212
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,416
[exhales]

213
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,541
[woman] How old are they?

214
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,791
Uh, Bianca is 25 and Martha is 23.

215
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:40,875
[woman] No!

216
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:44,500
I mean, you're too young.
You must've started really early.

217
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,208
[Leda] I'm 48.

218
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,625
Shit. No.

219
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,500
You look amazing.

220
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,916
We were saying before,
you couldn't be more than 40.

221
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,208
Damn, you're lucky.

222
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,250
- What's your name?
- Leda.

223
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,666
- Neda?
- Leda.

224
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,083
Leda. Leda what?

225
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:03,625
Caruso.

226
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:06,375
Oh! Caruso from Queens.

227
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,416
I'm Callie.

228
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:10,875
Callisto.

229
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,666
It means the most beautiful.

230
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:17,750
You're not gonna have a bite?
Not even one bite?

231
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,916
- Oh.
- How can you hold cake and not eat it?

232
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,125
- [chuckles]
- Mmm.

233
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,708
- It's good, right?
- It's really good.

234
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:24,666
Yeah.

235
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,083
Um…

236
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:31,750
Look, I'm sorry about earlier as well.
I was feeling a bit anxious.

237
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:35,375
Yeah, well, you know, the sun can do that.

238
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:40,208
And, well, maybe your girls.
Being away from your girls, you know?

239
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,208
Yeah, well, you'll see.

240
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:49,416
Children are a crushing responsibility.

241
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,416
Happy birthday.

242
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,041
[twig snaps]

243
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:10,375
[cockrell crows]

244
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:19,125
- [thud]
- [shrieks and groans]

245
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:28,500
Oh.

246
00:22:45,208 --> 00:22:46,416
[inhales sharply]

247
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:50,666
[blues music playing]

248
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
[indistinct chatter in distance]

249
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:32,875
- Hi. Hello.
- Lyle. From upstairs.

250
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:35,416
- Yeah, of course.
- I'm glad you made it down here.

251
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,708
- It's not so bad, right?
- No.

252
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:40,791
- I hope we didn't disturb you.
- [Leda] Oh, no, no.

253
00:23:42,541 --> 00:23:43,916
What are you drinking?

254
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,833
Oh, I'm fine. I'm still half full.

255
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:50,750
Nice to have a place like this,
just down the stairs.

256
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:54,208
You know, especially when you're alone.

257
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:59,416
- Keeps you from eating canned beans.
- Or rotten fruit.

258
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,583
[both laughing]

259
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,375
- Uh, I forget to eat entirely sometimes.
- Oh, that's not good.

260
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:13,625
I saw you at the beach today.
Callie's birthday party.

261
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:16,750
Oh, well, I wasn't exactly at the party.
I didn't see you.

262
00:24:16,833 --> 00:24:17,875
I saw you.

263
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,416
- You know, you're settling in upstairs?
- Yeah. It's great. Thanks.

264
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,333
- Yeah? Everything's okay in the apartment?
- Yeah, it's great. Thank you.

265
00:24:27,416 --> 00:24:30,416
Did you find that remote?
You know, for the fan?

266
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:33,166
No, I prefer
to pull the string to turn it on.

267
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,166
- The fan.
- [laughing] Pull.

268
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,666
Pulling the ol' string, eh?

269
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,250
[both chuckling]

270
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,791
[Lyle sighs]

271
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:44,708
- The apartment's great.
- It's a good one.

272
00:24:44,791 --> 00:24:46,000
Bright and white.

273
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,416
- Feels like you're on a boat almost.
- Yes.

274
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,625
- [Lyle] No, no, I got it.
- Oh, no, really.

275
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:55,375
- I insist.
- Oh, thank you.

276
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,666
Just let me know
if I can do anything for you.

277
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,750
I will. Thank you.

278
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:10,958
Do you mind
if I finish my dinner now, Lyle?

279
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:12,958
Oh, sure.

280
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:17,791
[sighing]

281
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:20,208
- Yeah.
- Okay.

282
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:24,583
[men conversing indistinctly]

283
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,041
[speaks Italian] A beautiful game.

284
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:06,833
[in English] Sorry.

285
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:12,333
[men conversing indistinctly]

286
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,583
[Nina] Damn it!

287
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,500
You do whatever the fuck you want.
You wanna take care of your baby girl?

288
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:23,458
You say you miss us.

289
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,958
You wanna come back and you want me.
You want this ass?

290
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:33,541
What? You're such a piece of shit.

291
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,125
[Nina's husband] I'm a piece of shit?

292
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:38,041
[Nina] Fuck you! Hey!

[insects buzzing]

295
00:27:24,166 --> 00:27:25,083
[Nina] Elena?

296
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,416

Come on.

Yeah.

Thank God you were here. Thank God.

346
00:30:26,833 --> 00:30:29,625
Sometimes it's easier for strangers
in these situations.

347
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:32,333
[Callie] Yeah, I was so crazy,
I couldn't see right.

348
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:35,083
You know, so many awful things can happen.

349
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,250
People are so fucked up. [gasps]

350
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:38,875
Oh, my God.

351
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:41,250
What happened to your back?

352
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:44,958
- It was a pine cone from the beach path.
- [Callie] A pine cone?

353
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:48,083
That looks so awful.
Did you put something on it?

354
00:30:48,166 --> 00:30:49,291
[Leda] No, I haven't.

355
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:51,625
Oh, no. No. Oh, I have something for you.

356
00:30:51,708 --> 00:30:53,125
It's so good. Hold on.

357
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:59,125
- I like your bathing suit.
- [Leda] Oh, thank you.

358
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:00,333
[Nina] Mm-hmm.

359
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:02,750
- [Elena crying]
- So she's not calming down?

360
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:06,500
Yeah.

361
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:08,250
[crying] Mommy!

362
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,916
- [Nina's husband] Stop.
- [Nina] Weird day.

363
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,166
[Leda] Hmm.

364
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,208
We found her and then she lost

365
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:15,250
<i>her</i> doll.

366
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:20,625
I used to have a doll like that.
Called Mina.

367
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:22,625
- Nina?
- Mina.

368
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,416
Or Mini-Mama, as my mother called her.

369
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:27,750
You'll find it.

370
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:30,625
- Yeah.
- [woman] Do you want a toy?

371
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:33,083
- [indistinct chatter]
- [Elena continues crying]

372
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:45,375
- [Callie] How's that?
- [Leda] Good, thank you. It's cold.

373
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:50,083
[Callie] Yes. It's really amazing.
It's gonna make you feel so much better.

374
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:53,666
Okay, by tonight,
you're gonna feel amazing.

375
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,750
- All right? All right.
- Thank you. Yeah.

376
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:58,291
[Callie] And let's go.
Let's find the doll.

377
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,500
I… I can't hear her scream anymore.

378
00:32:03,666 --> 00:32:04,583
See you tomorrow.

379
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:08,666
[Elena crying] Mama!

380
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:11,083
- Bye.
- [Leda] Bye.

381
00:32:24,708 --> 00:32:27,291
[cicadas chirping]

382
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,333
[young Leda whispers]
<i>I've got a special gift for you.</i>

383
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:54,125
Open your eyes.

384
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:57,041
Hmm?

385
00:32:57,833 --> 00:33:00,583
This was Mama's doll
when she was a little girl.

386
00:33:00,666 --> 00:33:03,541
- [Bianca] What's her name?
- Her name's Mina.

387
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:07,166
- [Bianca] Mummy?
- [Leda] Mm-hmm.

388
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:10,708
- [Bianca] Can I have a cuddle?
- [chuckling] You can have a cuddle.

389
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:15,375
Aw.

390
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:18,666
[thunder rumbling]

391
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:25,666
[Bianca] Give you some medicine

392
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:31,250
because then you'll have nice nails.

393
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:32,458
Yeah.

394
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:37,125
[Bianca] Very messy.
And you won't get better.

395
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:38,291
[Leda] Mm-hmm.

396
00:33:38,375 --> 00:33:41,666
I'm just gonna close my eyes
for a few seconds, baby. Okay?

397
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,625
[Bianca] Okay.

398
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:45,583
Can you see what my eye color is?

399
00:33:45,666 --> 00:33:48,208
- Hmm. Brown?
- [Bianca] No.

400
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:49,916
They're red.

401
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:52,166
- Do you see?
- [Leda] Yeah.

402
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:59,750
[Bianca] Uh, I'll just
have to brush your hair.

403
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,416
Ow! Fuck! Ouch!

404
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:12,291
Bianca, no!

405
00:34:13,583 --> 00:34:14,541
Ouch.

406
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,125
[Martha crying]

407
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:22,208
- You said we would have a date.
- I can't just let her cry.

408
00:34:22,291 --> 00:34:26,666
You've got to… I'll give you
a few more seconds to come back.

409
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:31,375
Three, two, one.

410
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,750
[Martha continues crying]

411
00:34:39,041 --> 00:34:40,041
[sighs]

412
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:43,583
[Bianca crying]

413
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:51,166
Here. Why don't you play with Mini-Mama?

414
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,958
You can brush her hair, yeah?

415
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:58,041
- [Martha] Oh, Mama, come!
- I'll be back in two seconds.

416
00:34:58,125 --> 00:34:59,625
[Martha crying]

417
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:01,125
[brush clatters]

418
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:06,500
[young Leda] <i>Bianca?</i>

419
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:10,375
<i>Bianca!</i>

420
00:35:10,916 --> 00:35:12,666
[Bianca speaking indistinctly]

421
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,791
[Leda] Bianca! Come on! Dinner.

422
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:18,625
[Bianca] That seems fine.

423
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,375
Are you ignoring me?

424
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:23,416
I've called you so many times for dinner.

425
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:25,833
- [speaking indistinctly]
- Bianca?

426
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,583
What are you sitting on? Bianca!

427
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:32,083
Get up.

428
00:35:33,875 --> 00:35:35,708
Get up. Get up.

429
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:39,916
[Leda] You don't like her?

430
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:43,000
I gave Mina to you
because I trusted you to take care of her.

431
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:45,166
You know, you can be very thoughtless.

432
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:48,458
This is <i>my</i> doll.
You can't treat her like shit.

433
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:50,375
No. She's mine.

434
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:53,750
Yeah, well, she's ruined.

435
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,916
[wind blowing]

436
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,666
[thunder rumbling]

437
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,291
[rain pattering]

438
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:42,875
- Oh, hi!
- Hi.

439
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:47,083
- You look like you stayed dry.
- Yeah, was it really bad?

440
00:36:47,166 --> 00:36:48,458
Yeah. No, it was crazy.

441
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:51,791
Everybody ran into the cafe,
and then it got too crowded.

442
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:54,916
Umbrellas started blowing away,
people's books, towels, yeah.

443
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,083
- Everyone was freaking out.
- Oh, dear.

444
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:02,083
Yeah, and the little girl, Elena,
she just… she wouldn't stop crying.

445
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:04,458
Yeah, she lost her doll or something.

446
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:06,583
- I like storms.
- [Will] Mmm.

447
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:09,000
Yeah, well, your books
woulda gotten ruined.

448
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:10,916
- Oh, did yours get wet?
- Yeah.

449
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:12,791
What are you studying?

450
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:14,625
- Business.
- In Greek?

451
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:16,541
No, no, I'm studying in Dublin,

452
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:19,041
and I just work here
for the summers, but, uh…

453
00:37:20,416 --> 00:37:22,833
Yeah, I'm a bit behind at college.

454
00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:25,833
You know, I wasted a lot of time.

455
00:37:26,625 --> 00:37:28,125
- Yeah.
- How old are you?

456
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:30,916
- Twenty-four.
- Oh, right between my daughters.

457
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,041
I heard you're a professor.

458
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,541
[chuckles] I think the correct response
is, "Sounds like fun."

459
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:38,125
- [chuckling] What?
- It's a rude joke.

460
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:41,166
- Will sandwich. Yeah.
- [Will chuckles]

461
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:43,166
Uh, I teach, yeah.

462
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:46,125
Yeah. Comp lit.
Italian literature, really.

463
00:37:46,208 --> 00:37:47,666
- All right.
- But I'm skiving off.

464
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,250
Right, right, ahem, yeah,
comparative literature.

465
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:51,833
Mmm. Yeah.

466
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:55,916
- I saw you know a lot of languages?
- I don't know anything very well.

467
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:59,125
I also wasted a lot of time. [chuckles]

468
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,833
Do you wanna have dinner with me?

469
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:05,458
Yeah, I should go shower and change and--

470
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:06,583
No, you're fine as you are.

471
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:09,333
- I don't have my wallet.
- Uh, I'm inviting you. Come on.

472
00:38:09,416 --> 00:38:10,583
Okay.

473
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:12,291
[both laughing]

474
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:18,500
- That was so funny.
- [coughing]

475
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:20,583
Vassili is Callie's husband.

476
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:23,500
Oh, I thought he was married
to the older, heavyset woman.

477
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:25,541
- Oh, come on.
- What?

478
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:27,666
- She's fat.
- [gasps]

479
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,875
No, but that's Callie's aunt, I think.

480
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:33,250
- And Lyle, who looks after my place.
- He works for them.

481
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:35,041
- Oh…
- Mmm.

482
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:38,291
- And Nina's husband is…
- Toni.

483
00:38:39,125 --> 00:38:40,458
- Toni?
- Yeah.

484
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:43,666
Yeah, he, um, comes up the weekends.

485
00:38:44,541 --> 00:38:46,916
He has investments in Kalamata.

486
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,208
- Sounds dodgy.
- Yeah. Mmm.

487
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:52,541
And then they all rent
one of these huge villas by the cliffs.

488
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:54,916
It's pink.

489
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,458
- It's pink?
- Yeah.

490
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:58,958
- [both chuckles]
- They rent the same one every year.

491
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:03,583
Wow, it's like talking about a film I saw
in a language I didn't quite understand.

492
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:05,541
You watch movies
in languages you don't know?

493
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:07,458
- Yeah.
- Without subtitles?

494
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:08,416
Yeah.

495
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,833
[both laughing]

496
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:15,125
And you were saying that,
um, your kids are my age?

497
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:17,708
Yeah, 25 and 23. Bianca and Martha.

498
00:39:17,791 --> 00:39:20,958
Hmm. And do they look like you?

499
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:23,833
I don't know. It's hard to say,
if I'm honest. They probably do.

500
00:39:23,916 --> 00:39:24,916
Oh.

501
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,250
Because you're beautiful.

502
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:27,750
[both chuckles]

503
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:30,958
- You're a very smart boy.
- [both chuckle]

504
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:33,791
My mother was very beautiful.

505
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:38,625
And, um, when I was about Martha's age,
I felt like she hadn't shared it.

506
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:41,083
Like, in creating me
she'd separated herself,

507
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:44,291
like pushing a plate away
if the food's repulsive.

508
00:39:44,375 --> 00:39:46,500
- [Will] Hmm.
- [Leda] Hmm.

509
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:48,291
But Bianca and Martha, it's funny.

510
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:52,625
What I find most interesting
are the secret resemblances.

511
00:39:52,708 --> 00:39:53,791
- [Will] Hmm.
- You know?

512
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:57,500
So what makes Bianca seductive
and Martha not, and vice versa.

513
00:39:57,583 --> 00:39:58,708
Well, they blame me.

514
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,208
Like, when I was younger,
I had small breasts.

515
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:06,583
And then as soon as I gave birth,
big breasts.

516
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:11,541
And Bianca has big breasts,
and Martha has almost none, like a boy.

517
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:15,375
And she doesn't realize
how beautiful she is.

518
00:40:15,458 --> 00:40:18,500
And she wears a padded bra
and it sort of humiliates her.

519
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,208
And she thinks
I've given the best of myself to Bianca.

520
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:23,541
She feels deprived.

521
00:40:24,541 --> 00:40:27,833
And, um, I do understand. And, like…

522
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:30,791
Long time ago,
at some point, I considered,

523
00:40:30,875 --> 00:40:33,625
only half seriously,
considered having implants.

524
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:39,125
But, um, they come from nowhere,
so what are they worth?

525
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:40,916
You know?

526
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:44,041
But Bianca is completely different,

527
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:46,500
and she would never
let herself feel deprived.

528
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:50,333
She sucks everything out of me.
All my secret skills.

529
00:40:51,333 --> 00:40:54,083
She pointed out
I'm finicky about peeling fruit.

530
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:55,000
[Will] Hmm.

531
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:56,583
I don't like it when the peel breaks.

532
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:59,833
I like when it comes off
in one long whatsit?

533
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:02,166
- [WIll] String… [chuckles]
- String. [chuckles]

534
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:05,250
- Yeah, very, very uptight.
- Yeah. [laughing]

535
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:07,208
Didn't even know that about myself.

536
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:12,041
- Yeah, of course I understand.
- [young Leda muttering]

537
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:15,708
The problem for me is why did they
schedule them so close together?

538
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:18,875
[young Leda muttering]

539
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,041
Baby… Babe…

540
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:25,166
Huh?

541
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,750
- [girls crying in distance]
- [whispers] It's Sunday. You're on.

542
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:29,750
[whispers] It's Columbia.

543
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:38,666
[muffled]

544
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,500
[crying in distance]

545
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:42,916
[speaking indistinctly]

546
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,041
I'm working.

547
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:45,625
I'm suffocating.

548
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:49,541
- [crying] Please, can you kiss it?
- [Leda] Yeah, sit down.

549
00:41:49,625 --> 00:41:54,041
- Mama, please, can you kiss it?
- Sit down.

550
00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:55,458
[clicking tongue]

551
00:41:55,541 --> 00:41:56,708
What did you do that for?

552
00:41:56,791 --> 00:42:02,083
I wanted to peel it
like a snake like you do. [sniffles]

553
00:42:03,375 --> 00:42:06,458
Please. Please, can you kiss it?

554
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:09,416
It really hurts.

555
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:13,791
Mama! [crying]

556
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:17,833
Kiss it.

557
00:42:18,916 --> 00:42:22,791
[crying] Please. [sniffles]

558
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:26,958
Please.

559
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:30,125
[Bianca continues crying]

560
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:38,583
[young Leda] I can't leave you alone
for one minute.

561
00:42:38,666 --> 00:42:41,750
[Bianca continues crying]

562
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:47,583
There's this great poem by María Guerra.

563
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:49,625
<i>"Haciendo serpentinas"?</i>

564
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:52,333
[Will hesitates] No.

565
00:42:52,416 --> 00:42:54,375
Have you ever read "Leda and the Swan"?

566
00:42:54,458 --> 00:42:55,750
No.

567
00:42:55,833 --> 00:42:57,541
Okay. That's in English.

568
00:42:57,625 --> 00:43:00,041
- Okay.
- Plus, it's my namesake.

569
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:02,166
"The center cannot hold…"

570
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:04,958
Oh, that's a different…
that's a different Yeats.

571
00:43:06,541 --> 00:43:07,583
Um…

572
00:43:12,166 --> 00:43:13,208
[grunts]

573
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:16,041
My mum used to get quite dizzy.

574
00:43:16,125 --> 00:43:19,000
She, um… Every time she stood up,
happened all the time.

575
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:21,125
She said it's 'cause
she stood up too fast.

576
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:27,291
Oh, poor creatures
that came out of my belly.

577
00:43:27,375 --> 00:43:31,125
The bits I find most beautiful about them
are the bits that are alien to me.

578
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:34,083
So I don't have
to take responsibility for that.

579
00:43:37,791 --> 00:43:39,583
- Have I bored you?
- No.

580
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:41,333
Nina's very beautiful.

581
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:44,958
Yes.

582
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,416
I hope they find the doll.

583
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:53,250
They're all freaking out and…

584
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:56,583
I had to rake
the entire beach looking for it.

585
00:43:56,666 --> 00:43:57,916
- They will.
- Hmm.

586
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:01,708
What you did yesterday was amazing.

587
00:44:02,666 --> 00:44:04,750
When you wouldn't move from the umbrella.

588
00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:09,750
- But don't do things like that anymore.
- Why?

589
00:44:09,833 --> 00:44:10,791
[clicks tongue]

590
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:13,166
Because they're bad people.

591
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:34,750
[sniffs]

592
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,250
[groans]

593
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:51,750
Ugh!

594
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:01,250
[vehicle approaching]

595
00:45:06,041 --> 00:45:08,041
[indistinct chatter in distance]

596
00:45:47,083 --> 00:45:49,708
[young Leda] <i>Sometimes I get scared</i>
<i>I can't take care of them.</i>

597
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:55,000
What if I passed out,
alone with them when you're in Arizona?

598
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:58,458
[man] Baby, you're okay.

599
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:00,333
I promise.

600
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:03,625
Of course you can take care of them.

601
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:25,625
I'm just gonna take the dress
and the shoes and the socks.

602
00:46:25,708 --> 00:46:27,666
And leave the… Oh, no.

603
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:30,083
Actually, I'm gonna
take the jacket too. Thank you.

604
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:35,666
Leda.

605
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:39,541
- Hi.
- Hi.

606
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:43,083
- How are you?
- Good.

607
00:46:44,541 --> 00:46:46,083
Do you have grandkids already?

608
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:47,916
No.

609
00:46:48,666 --> 00:46:50,541
Did you use the ointment I gave you?

610
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:52,666
Oh, for my back.
Yeah, it feels much better.

611
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:53,875
- Thank you.
- Oh, good.

612
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:59,375
Hey. Hey, sweetie,
did you ever find your doll?

613
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,041
- [Callie] Oh, my God.
- Elena, do not do that.

614
00:47:03,125 --> 00:47:04,291
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

615
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:06,500
[Nina] She's super tired.

616
00:47:07,083 --> 00:47:10,000
Why don't you tell the lady
how we're gonna go

617
00:47:10,083 --> 00:47:13,708
and find Neni tomorrow
when it's not raining, right, honey?

618
00:47:13,791 --> 00:47:16,791
And then today
we're gonna get a doll for a big girl.

619
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:20,041
'Cause you're Mommy's big girl.
You're my big girl.

620
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:22,000
Whoever took her should get brain cancer.

621
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:24,583
[Vassili] Oh, come on.
It's kids' stuff, you understand?

622
00:47:24,666 --> 00:47:26,375
They like a toy, they take it. That's it.

623
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:28,291
[Callie] No, Arruno's children
aren't like kids.

624
00:47:28,375 --> 00:47:30,416
Yeah, it's their mom. She's a cunt.

625
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,458
[Vassili] I spoke to Toni
and the kids didn't take anything.

626
00:47:33,958 --> 00:47:35,541
- He's lying.
- [Vassili] Don't say that.

627
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:38,000
- Well, it's true.
- Don't say it.

628
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:40,333
[Callie] She's been through
a lot, you know?

629
00:47:40,416 --> 00:47:43,541
She's, like, had a fever,
she can't breathe at night.

630
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:46,166
She needs a Kleenex. We're furious.

631
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:48,875
- Do you have a Kleenex, actually?
- No, I don't. Sorry.

632
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:55,083
How high was the temperature?

633
00:47:55,166 --> 00:47:57,916
Barely 100. She's… She's okay.

634
00:47:58,750 --> 00:47:59,833
She's okay.

635
00:48:03,041 --> 00:48:05,916
[Nina] Okay, you wanna let Mama
put you down for a second?

636
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:08,666
[chuckles]

637
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:12,000
Come on.
Elena, let Mama put you down. Come on.

638
00:48:14,166 --> 00:48:15,958
- [Elena grunts]
- Stop. Stop it.

639
00:48:16,041 --> 00:48:19,833
Enough. Stop. Enough!
Stop acting like this. Let me…

640
00:48:20,916 --> 00:48:21,750
Fuck!

641
00:48:22,958 --> 00:48:25,250
[breathing heavily]

642
00:48:29,916 --> 00:48:31,750
[sighs] She's driving me crazy.

643
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:34,333
'Cause Daddy's away, right?

644
00:48:34,416 --> 00:48:37,541
Daddy's away,
and you're taking it out on me.

645
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,458
All right. Come to Auntie, baby.
Come on. Come to Auntie.

646
00:48:42,541 --> 00:48:45,708
There we go, my big girl. Oh! [grunts]

647
00:48:45,791 --> 00:48:48,583
- My big girl!
- Go. So I can have a minute.

648
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:52,250
Sometimes I just can't handle it.

649
00:48:53,416 --> 00:48:55,666
- I know.
- [Callie] Okay?

650
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:59,833
- [Elena speaks indistinctly]
- Yes, anything you want. Show Mama.

651
00:48:59,916 --> 00:49:03,291
Show Mama and the lady
what a good girl you are, okay?

652
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:04,250
Here you go.

653
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:07,625
You're okay. [kisses] You're okay.

654
00:49:10,041 --> 00:49:11,333
[exhales sharply]

655
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:14,125
They really put us through it, huh?

656
00:49:15,708 --> 00:49:18,083
I thought you said
you're pregnant with your first.

657
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:19,291
[Callie] I am.

658
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:22,166
What were your daughters like
when they were little?

659
00:49:22,833 --> 00:49:24,958
Were they like
this willful little creature?

660
00:49:25,583 --> 00:49:27,750
I honestly can't remember much, actually.

661
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:32,083
[Callie] Oh, no, you can't forget
anything about your own children.

662
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:35,083
Is that your experience?

663
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:41,333
I just mean, did your daughters give you
a hard time when they were little?

664
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:44,333
I just don't remember.

665
00:49:46,041 --> 00:49:48,333
- [Callie] You okay?
- She doesn't remember.

666
00:49:48,833 --> 00:49:50,375
[Leda] I was very tired.

667
00:49:50,875 --> 00:49:52,000
Sorry, excuse me.

668
00:49:52,083 --> 00:49:54,791
[objects clattering]

669
00:49:57,708 --> 00:49:58,541
Sorry.

670
00:49:58,625 --> 00:50:01,625
Don't bother buying her another doll.
It won't make any difference.

671
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:03,083
You'll find it.

672
00:50:05,291 --> 00:50:07,083
[thunder rumbling]

673
00:50:07,166 --> 00:50:10,166
- [rain pattering]
- [people clamoring]

674
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:21,333
[in Italian] <i>Stiamo disturbando…</i>

675
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:23,791
[repeating in Italian] <i>Stiamo disturbando…</i>

676
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:27,375
- [young Leda speaking Italian]
- [repeating in Italian]

677
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:29,916
[young Leda speaking Italian]

678
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,541
[Bianca in English]
Mama, how do you write "volcano"?

679
00:50:33,458 --> 00:50:35,958
[young Leda] <i>…dal nostro intento…</i>

680
00:50:36,041 --> 00:50:38,000
Mama, how do you write "volcano"?

681
00:50:40,333 --> 00:50:45,416
Mama. Is this how you write "volcano"?
Is this how you write "volcano"?

682
00:50:47,833 --> 00:50:48,750
[young Leda] <i>Su te…</i>

683
00:50:48,833 --> 00:50:50,583
- How do you--
- [in English] Don't do that!

684
00:50:53,041 --> 00:50:55,666
- Don't you dare, ever again, Bianca.
- [chuckles]

685
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:57,833
Listen to me. Don't you dare, ever again.

686
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:00,541
[Bianca laughs]

687
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:04,208
You don't hit Mama.

688
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:07,291
You can never, ever do that.
Do you understand?

689
00:51:07,833 --> 00:51:08,833
- Can--
- Out!

690
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:10,750
- No! No!
- Out!

691
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:16,208

Take your shoes off, now.

very, very careful in this house.

- [Bianca] I'm hungry.
- Daddy's eaten your snack.

00:54:18,916 --> 00:54:21,833
[Bianca] Daddy, you said we'd
make Blitzes so the sun would come out.

741
00:54:41,458 --> 00:54:42,833

- [Joe] To Quebec. They don't have food.
- Joe, it's not 1985.

[male hiker] I have kids.

752
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:08,166

757
00:55:18,666 --> 00:55:20,791

- Yes, we did.

758
00:55:21,958 --> 00:55:22,875
Hmm.

759
00:55:22,958 --> 00:55:25,791
We are obliged
to do so many stupid things.

760
00:55:25,875 --> 00:55:27,333
From childhood, even.

761
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:29,708
- Obliged?
- [female hiker] Yes.

762
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:32,625

763

- No.

865
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:31,541
Daughters. 25 and 23.

866
01:01:31,625 --> 01:01:33,625
Martha grew up worrying about me.

867
01:01:33,708 --> 01:01:37,041
Poor little thing. Checking that I ate,
didn't die at night, like a little mama.

868
01:01:37,125 --> 01:01:38,500
Bianca's like her father.

869
01:01:38,583 --> 01:01:40,833
She made me feel
like she wanted to remake me.

870
01:01:41,625 --> 01:01:43,750
Like her viciousness was for my own good.

871
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:45,500
Well, my oldest is 50.

872
01:01:46,125 --> 01:01:47,291
Actually 51.

873
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:49,375
- So, I win.
- [chuckles]

874
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:52,333
- Three times a grandfather.
- Oh.

875
01:01:53,583 --> 01:01:56,333
They're so soft when they're young.
Their little bodies.

876
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,833
- Are your kids on the island?
- No.

879
01:02:06,291 --> 01:02:09,416
You know, Leonard Cohen
used to come over here from Hydra.

880
01:02:09,958 --> 01:02:13,375
We'd write songs together.
They liked that, when I told them.

881
01:02:14,791 --> 01:02:18,000
Not real songs.
Just messing around. They liked that.

882
01:02:20,666 --> 01:02:22,250
And you know those uni shells?

883
01:02:22,958 --> 01:02:24,916
No? Sea urchins, you know…

884
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,208
- Oh, yeah.
- Purple, beautiful shells.

885
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,666
I used to fill them with cotton balls

886
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:31,875
and send 'em out to Philly
for their birthdays.

887
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:34,625
I'll look out for some for your girls.

888
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:37,875
You sound like a real family man.

889
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:40,500
Yeah.

891
01:02:46,708 --> 01:02:48,541
[hesitates] Yeah, I taught…

892
01:02:49,083 --> 01:02:50,833
I taught them all how to swim.

893

904
01:03:26,083 --> 01:03:27,291
It means "mean."

01:03:27,958 --> 01:03:28,833
"Cruel."

01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:42,166

- Do you feel sick?
- No, I'm fine.

910

Why don't you lay down for a minute?

911

Now, now, it'll pass.

01:04:26,291 --> 01:04:28,458
Nothing needs to pass, Lyle. I feel fine.

just for being good. [chuckles]

And she loves Cheetah.

971

Um, so if she's a bit upset at nighttime,
you can give her Cheetah.

972

I left Joe's mum's number,

973

at dinner, so… Thank you, thank you! Ah!

I'll call every-- I left my mum's number.

Only call her
if you can't get through to anyone else.

I made dinner
for Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,

977

and I labeled which is for which days…

978

I did soak some black beans,
but didn't get a chance to… Do you cook?

- Mm-hmm.
- I've left the recipe on the fridge. Easy.

This is the paper I'm giving.

991
01:10:58,166 --> 01:11:00,750
I'm not sure it's persuasive.

994

chafes against
the intrinsically human desire

995
01:11:11,208 --> 01:11:13,041
for metaphysical meaning.

996
01:11:13,666 --> 01:11:17,458
[clearing throat]

997

[indistinct chatter]

999
01:12:00,125 --> 01:12:01,333
Bourdieu…

1000
01:12:02,333 --> 01:12:05,666
Bourdieu's mistake is that he often forgot
the first part of his own name.

[laughter]

1002
01:12:08,291 --> 01:12:11,125

Walter is sensitive. Where is he?

01:12:11,708 --> 01:12:13,416
That's terrible.

1004
01:12:14,666 --> 01:12:16,541
But what I really want to consider,

1005
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:19,250
and I promise
I'm gonna bring this back to Auden,

1006
01:12:19,333 --> 01:12:23,250
is that which is
not only ineffable [clicks tongue]

1007
01:12:23,333 --> 01:12:24,541
but unthought.

1008
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:31,083
I've been really turned on
by Ricœur's recent thinking

1009
01:12:31,166 --> 01:12:33,625
on linguistic hospitality and…

1010
01:12:33,708 --> 01:12:35,625
[laughing]

1011
01:12:36,708 --> 01:12:39,083
How about his name, Ricœur…

1012
01:12:39,791 --> 01:12:42,166
Gosh, I should really
lean into that second syllable,

1013
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:44,250
because, God, he comes from the heart.

1014
01:12:45,291 --> 01:12:46,583
Um…

1018
01:13:04,125 --> 01:13:09,583
Oh, I'm reading the most astounding piece
on Auden's "The Crisis" by Leda Caruso,

1019
01:13:10,583 --> 01:13:13,333
and it seems to me
that she has anticipated

1020
01:13:13,416 --> 01:13:16,750
Ricœur's recent thinking
on linguistic hospitality.

1021
01:13:16,833 --> 01:13:17,708
For her…

1022
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:25,916
hospitality comes
in holding one's attention,

1023
01:13:26,625 --> 01:13:27,750
even in crisis.

1024
01:13:28,458 --> 01:13:30,708

01:13:30,791 --> 01:13:36,041
"Attention is the rarest
and purest form of generosity."

01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:39,250
[young Leda] Suddenly he was
just saying my name. And it was…

1027
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:42,000
[chuckles] It was crazy.

1028
01:13:42,875 --> 01:13:46,666
He was… No, he was talking
about the Auden publication.

1029
01:13:47,375 --> 01:13:48,833
He was saying that, um…

1030
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:54,500
He was saying that I had anticipated
Ricœur's work on translation and…

1031
01:13:54,583 --> 01:13:56,583
[both panting]

1032
01:13:57,375 --> 01:14:01,041
That, yeah. That I had anticipated
Ricœur's work on translation,

1033
01:14:01,125 --> 01:14:03,916
and it was just…
I mean, it was… [sputters]

1034
01:14:04,458 --> 01:14:05,833
…wild.

1035
01:14:06,916 --> 01:14:08,208

Leda Caruso is inside
Auden's private mythology.

1039
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:23,291
Thank God, because whenever
one tries to suppress doubt,

1040
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:25,875
there is tyranny.

1041

1042
01:14:35,708 --> 01:14:37,000
She's got chicken pox?

1043
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:42,041
That's crazy, she just had a little cold.
Does she have a fever?

1044
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:44,125
Oh.

1045
01:14:44,208 --> 01:14:46,250
That's not really a fever.

1046
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:47,375
No.

1047
01:14:47,458 --> 01:14:51,958
I haven't… I haven't even…
I haven't even read his recent work.

1048
01:14:52,791 --> 01:14:54,500
It was all my own thinking.

1049
01:14:57,458 --> 01:14:59,708
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Put her on the phone.

1050
01:15:04,916 --> 01:15:06,125
[knocking on door]

1051
01:15:06,208 --> 01:15:08,125
Hi, sweetheart.

1052
01:15:09,333 --> 01:15:12,208
[sighs] Hi. Is it itchy?

1053
01:15:12,291 --> 01:15:15,791
[clicks tongue] Aw, I know.
It's not very nice.

1054
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:18,291
Did Daddy give you a DVD?

1055

[knocking on door]

1056
01:15:20,333 --> 01:15:23,708
Yeah, well, just don't forget
it gets a little bit scary when the…

1057
01:15:23,791 --> 01:15:26,333
Um, can you just hang on
one minute, sweetheart?

1058
01:15:26,416 --> 01:15:27,916
- Yeah. Coming. One--

Oh.

1061
01:15:34,708 --> 01:15:37,291
- Sorry to disturb you.
- No, no, no. Not at all.

1062
01:15:37,375 --> 01:15:40,375
I came by to congratulate you
on your success tonight.

1063
01:15:40,458 --> 01:15:41,708
Oh, thank you.

1064
01:15:41,791 --> 01:15:44,458
You'll have to get
the Yeats piece finished now.

1065
01:15:44,541 --> 01:15:47,166
- Another publication is important.
- Yeah. For sure.

1066
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:50,041
Yes. I'll tell Hardy how we're working.

1067
01:15:51,208 --> 01:15:53,916
Dinner is in 20 minutes
in the dining room.

1068
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:56,875
I've arranged a seat for you.

1069
01:15:56,958 --> 01:15:59,750
[young Leda] Oh, my goodness.
Um… Thank you.

1070
01:16:18,916 --> 01:16:21,541
Hello. Sorry, I think this is my car.

1071
01:16:25,583 --> 01:16:28,708
- You think it's your car?
- Yeah. It's a rental.

1072
01:16:32,875 --> 01:16:33,958
Excuse us.

1073
01:16:36,125 --> 01:16:39,000
- Lyle tells me you're renting his place.
- Did he?

1074
01:16:39,083 --> 01:16:40,000
[Toni] Mmm.

1075
01:16:40,916 --> 01:16:43,625
I mean, teachers get to take
the whole summer off. That's nice.

1076
01:16:44,125 --> 01:16:45,916
Well, it's a working holiday.

1077
01:16:46,458 --> 01:16:48,458
[Toni chuckles]

1078
01:16:49,625 --> 01:16:50,625
I like it. Yeah.

1079
01:16:50,708 --> 01:16:51,708
Me too.

1080
01:16:53,541 --> 01:16:57,250
You know, thanks for helping
with Elena the other day.

1081
01:16:57,333 --> 01:17:00,583
And with Nina. She can get spacey.

1082
01:17:01,791 --> 01:17:03,291
Sure. Excuse me.

1083
01:17:03,375 --> 01:17:04,583
[door handle thudding]

1084
01:17:05,666 --> 01:17:08,583
- Oh. Not my car. It's…
- No.

1085
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:11,000
[Leda] Bye.

1086
01:17:16,291 --> 01:17:17,208
[Toni] Bye.

1088
01:17:41,583 --> 01:17:43,083
I didn't realize you were here.

1089
01:17:43,958 --> 01:17:47,625
- It's really great to meet you.
- It's great to meet you too.

1090
01:17:48,208 --> 01:17:50,166
Your work is thrilling.

1091
01:17:51,666 --> 01:17:52,666
Thank you.

1092
01:17:53,541 --> 01:17:54,666
Thrilling.

[Cole sighing]

1096
01:18:11,083 --> 01:18:12,916
He is a serious scholar, but--

1097
01:18:13,958 --> 01:18:16,083
It's amazing to see. Amazing.

1098
01:18:16,166 --> 01:18:17,958
- What is?
- Well…

1099
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:24,000
It would be interesting to see his tactics
as he renews his pursuit this evening.

1100
01:18:37,375 --> 01:18:38,458
[Leda] Excuse me.

1101
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:51,625
Where is the waiter?

1102
01:18:52,583 --> 01:18:54,208
Some Champagne, please.

1103
01:18:55,458 --> 01:18:57,916
- [laughing]
- [young Leda] Don't cry! No, no, no!

1104
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,708
I loved…
I loved the jokes about their names.

1105
01:19:02,916 --> 01:19:05,416
- It made you seem more human.
- Human?

1106
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:08,583
- As opposed to what?
- As opposed to a god.

1107
01:19:09,958 --> 01:19:11,416
Ah. Mmm.

1108
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:15,708
Your name. Leda. It's very provocative.

1109
01:19:15,791 --> 01:19:18,458
[chuckles] You're thinking
about the Yeats.

[clicks tongue]

1111
01:19:20,666 --> 01:19:23,625
Very high-minded.
It always brings rape to mind.

Jesus.

1205
01:26:21,166 --> 01:26:23,375
[in Italian] I don't want
to come in your mouth.

1206
01:26:23,875 --> 01:26:27,583
I want to wait until you're inside me.

1207
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:35,958
[in English] Well, maybe it's good for you
not to get exactly what you want.

1208
01:26:37,666 --> 01:26:41,541
Please, Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama. Please.

1209
01:26:45,125 --> 01:26:47,458
Oh, fuck, yeah.

1210
01:26:47,541 --> 01:26:52,166
[young Leda] Yes, baby. I'm gonna
get you sweets from London. Mm-hmm.

1211
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:53,083
What?

1212
01:26:54,583 --> 01:26:55,500
I can't…

1213
01:26:56,458 --> 01:26:58,416
Bia… I can't…

1214
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:02,208
Bianca, can you turn the phone around?
I can't… I can't hear Martha.

1215
01:27:02,833 --> 01:27:03,833
Hmm?

1216
01:27:04,416 --> 01:27:08,375
Aw! Okay, babies.
I can't wait to see you too. I love you.

1217
01:27:09,125 --> 01:27:11,791
No, you hang up first.
It's better that way.

1218
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:17,041
Okay. Love you. Bye. Bye-bye. [kissing]

1219
01:27:17,708 --> 01:27:19,666
I love you. [chuckles]

1220
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:20,833
Okay.

1221
01:27:20,916 --> 01:27:22,125
[clears throat]

1222
01:27:22,208 --> 01:27:23,416
[line disconnects]

1223
01:27:25,833 --> 01:27:27,791
I hate talking to my kids on the phone.

1224
01:27:28,708 --> 01:27:29,625
What?

1225
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,500
[whispers] I hate talking
to my kids on the phone.

1226
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,541
- They don't like it either.
- Don't say that.

1227
01:27:38,625 --> 01:27:39,583
They don't.

1228
01:27:41,291 --> 01:27:42,375
Don't say that.

1229
01:27:45,875 --> 01:27:46,708
[slaps]

1230
01:27:47,875 --> 01:27:48,833
Okay.

1231
01:27:56,375 --> 01:27:57,625
- [doorbell rings]
- [gasps]

1232
01:27:57,708 --> 01:27:59,708
[thunder rumbling]

1233
01:28:00,916 --> 01:28:03,333
[doorbell ringing]

1234
01:28:07,541 --> 01:28:08,458
Hello?

1235
01:28:12,583 --> 01:28:13,541
Hello?

1236
01:28:34,833 --> 01:28:36,916
[foghorn blaring]

1237
01:28:39,125 --> 01:28:40,000
Shit.

1238
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:45,000
[cell phone ringtone playing]

1239
01:28:50,375 --> 01:28:51,250
Hello?

1240
01:28:52,166 --> 01:28:53,583
Yeah, this is she.

1241
01:28:56,166 --> 01:28:57,750
Oh, is everything okay?

1242
01:28:59,833 --> 01:29:05,041
Uh, yeah, I'm at the last store
by the boats. It sells vintage jewelry.

1243
01:29:06,375 --> 01:29:07,750
I won't move from here.

1244
01:29:16,958 --> 01:29:19,291
I've been following you
for, like, ten minutes.

1245
01:29:19,375 --> 01:29:22,458
- Yeah, you said, is everything okay?
- What? Yeah?

1246
01:29:25,666 --> 01:29:29,250
Your number came up on my phone yesterday.

1247
01:29:30,541 --> 01:29:33,333
- You called me?
- I did. Yeah.

1248
01:29:33,416 --> 01:29:34,416
[Elena] Lady.

1249
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:37,000
Hey, little one. Are you feeling better?

1250
01:29:37,083 --> 01:29:38,875
She needs her medicine.

1251
01:29:38,958 --> 01:29:41,208
- Your doll, is she sick?
- [Nina] She's not getting over it.

1252
01:29:42,375 --> 01:29:44,875
She wants her doll. Shit.

1253
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,208
- It won't stay on.
- Oh, hey.

1254
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:55,166
Can I?

1255
01:29:56,750 --> 01:29:59,625
My grandma used to use hat pins.
It won't fall off now.

1256
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:02,750
Okay. Hat.

1257
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:06,625
All right?

1258
01:30:08,541 --> 01:30:10,333
- Do it where it's comfy.
- [sighs]

1259
01:30:23,291 --> 01:30:26,125
[Nina] Since the doll went missing,
she's been, like, actually

1260
01:30:26,208 --> 01:30:28,458
driving me fucking crazy.

1261
01:30:29,166 --> 01:30:30,125
I…

1262
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:33,333
There's something wrong with her.
She's not sleeping.

1263
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:37,041
At all. She won't sleep
unless I'm in the bed with her.

1264
01:30:37,125 --> 01:30:38,666
And if I move…

1265
01:30:38,750 --> 01:30:41,750
I'm really tired. I'm, like, scary tired.

1266
01:30:41,833 --> 01:30:43,166
Mm, I remember.

1267
01:30:51,583 --> 01:30:53,291
I know you saw me with Will.

1268
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:56,458
Um…

1269
01:30:58,958 --> 01:31:00,916
I don't want you to think badly of me.

1270
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:03,291
I don't think badly of anyone.

1271
01:31:04,416 --> 01:31:05,333
Yeah.

1272
01:31:06,208 --> 01:31:09,250
Yeah, uh, see, I knew that.
As soon as I saw you, I just…

1273
01:31:10,083 --> 01:31:12,791
- I was like, "I wanna be like that lady."
- [chuckles]

1274
01:31:16,208 --> 01:31:18,416
[Nina] <i>It didn't mean anything,</i>
<i>what you saw.</i>

1275
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:19,750
[Leda] <i>Didn't it?</i>

1276
01:31:20,541 --> 01:31:22,166
[Nina scoffing] No.

1277
01:31:23,208 --> 01:31:26,291
<i>I don't let it go anywhere. I just…</i>

1278
01:31:28,666 --> 01:31:30,041
But I'm happy.

1279
01:31:30,875 --> 01:31:33,666
I'm happy with Elena,
with-- with everything.

1280
01:31:33,750 --> 01:31:34,666
I'm…

1281
01:31:37,333 --> 01:31:38,666
I met my husband so young.

1282
01:31:40,375 --> 01:31:42,458
And he's fucking crazy about me.

1283
01:31:43,208 --> 01:31:44,333
And her.

1284
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:48,458
He says my breasts
are exactly the size of his hand.

1285
01:31:50,416 --> 01:31:52,333
[Leda] What would he do
if he saw you with Will?

1286
01:31:52,833 --> 01:31:54,708
Oh, he'd cut my throat.

1287
01:31:55,458 --> 01:31:56,833
I don't want to talk about him.

1288
01:31:56,916 --> 01:32:00,125
I only have, like, five minutes
before Callie finishes shopping.

1289
01:32:00,208 --> 01:32:01,583
She doesn't want you to talk to me?

1290
01:32:01,666 --> 01:32:03,666
She doesn't want me
to do fucking anything.

1291
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:05,000
Who gives a fuck?

1292
01:32:10,666 --> 01:32:12,041
Can I ask you something?

1293
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:13,958
[Leda] Sure.

1294
01:32:16,708 --> 01:32:18,375
What happened in the toy store?

1295
01:32:23,416 --> 01:32:25,708
You were talking
about your daughters and then

1296
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:28,666
something happened.

1297
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:31,875
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1298
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:33,708
Yeah.

1299
01:32:40,125 --> 01:32:41,458
I left.

1300
01:32:45,375 --> 01:32:46,250
Oh.

1301
01:32:48,541 --> 01:32:51,708
When the oldest was seven
and the youngest was five, I left.

1302
01:32:51,791 --> 01:32:52,958
[sobbing softly]

1303
01:32:54,750 --> 01:32:57,291
I abandoned them
and I didn't see them for three years.

1304
01:32:57,375 --> 01:32:59,916
You didn't see your children
for three years?

1305
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:00,958
No.

1306
01:33:05,083 --> 01:33:06,541
Who took care of them?

1307
01:33:07,416 --> 01:33:10,333
Their father and my mum,
and then I came back for them.

1308
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:16,666
What did it feel like without them?

1309
01:33:18,625 --> 01:33:20,125
[sobbing]

1310
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:21,625
[sniffs]

1311
01:33:22,708 --> 01:33:24,125
It felt amazing.

1312
01:33:28,375 --> 01:33:31,541
Felt like I'd been trying not to explode
and then I exploded.

1313
01:33:37,083 --> 01:33:38,541
That doesn't sound amazing.

1314
01:33:39,541 --> 01:33:40,541
Okay.

1315
01:33:46,750 --> 01:33:49,625
- There's Callie and your husband.
- My husband?

1316
01:33:51,583 --> 01:33:52,833
What the fuck is he doing here?

1317
01:33:52,916 --> 01:33:55,083
He's not supposed to be here
until tomorrow.

1318
01:33:56,666 --> 01:33:58,375
Fuck. I have to go.

1319
01:34:07,583 --> 01:34:09,041
[indistinct conversation]

1320
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,083
[grunts]

1321
01:34:31,375 --> 01:34:32,833
[door opening]

1322
01:34:34,291 --> 01:34:37,166
[young Leda gasps] Hi, guys.

1323
01:34:40,250 --> 01:34:41,833
- Hey.
- Hi.

1324
01:34:41,916 --> 01:34:43,416
- Hmm.
- [kisses]

1325
01:34:45,166 --> 01:34:49,083
[Joe chuckling] What are you doing?
Say hello to Mummy.

1326
01:34:49,166 --> 01:34:52,250
Martha. Go on. Go say hello.

1327
01:34:52,791 --> 01:34:54,500
["I Told Jesus" by Roberta Flack playing]

1328
01:34:54,583 --> 01:34:55,625
It's okay.

1329
01:34:58,250 --> 01:35:00,500
- [Leda] Can I get a hug?
- [Joe] Go on.

1330
01:35:01,125 --> 01:35:02,500
- [exclaims]
- Oh!

1331
01:35:02,583 --> 01:35:04,208
[chuckles]

1332
01:35:05,291 --> 01:35:06,541
Mmm.

1333
01:35:07,166 --> 01:35:09,166
Are you home now, Mummy?

1334
01:35:09,250 --> 01:35:10,500
I'm home today.

1335
01:35:11,208 --> 01:35:14,958
Can you wash my hair after dinner?

1336
01:35:15,041 --> 01:35:20,666
Mm-mmm. I can't stay for dinner, baby.
I've got to get on an airplane.

1337
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:22,041
Oh, okay.

1338
01:35:22,125 --> 01:35:23,250
[chuckles]

1339
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:27,583
But I brought you presents. Hmm?

1340
01:35:28,416 --> 01:35:30,166
And fancy dresses.

1341
01:35:35,083 --> 01:35:36,125
These.

1342
01:35:37,291 --> 01:35:38,166
Hi.

1343
01:35:40,791 --> 01:35:42,125
Yours!

1344
01:35:48,875 --> 01:35:53,375
You awoke the tickle monster.
There's a tickle monster in town.

1345
01:35:53,458 --> 01:35:58,458
Bianca? Do you want me to help you
do your buttons up in the back?

1346
01:35:58,541 --> 01:35:59,625
[Bianca] No.

1347
01:36:00,125 --> 01:36:01,125
[young Leda] Okay.

1348
01:36:03,250 --> 01:36:04,541
Show me your dress.

1349
01:36:05,041 --> 01:36:07,708
Oh! So pretty.

1350
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:09,500
Mwah.

1351
01:36:09,583 --> 01:36:11,291
[both laughing]

1352
01:36:12,916 --> 01:36:15,583
- Leda, can I talk to you?
- Sure.

1353
01:36:22,791 --> 01:36:25,958
[crying] Please. Please don't this.

1354
01:36:26,041 --> 01:36:29,541
Come on, what do you fucking need?
Do need me on my knees?

1355
01:36:29,625 --> 01:36:32,708
Do you need me to cut my balls off?
What do you need? Tell me.

1356
01:36:34,291 --> 01:36:36,833
Have you got his cock in your mouth,
you can't answer me?

1357
01:36:36,916 --> 01:36:38,708
Joe, this has nothing to do with that.

1358
01:36:38,791 --> 01:36:40,500
Oh, fuck me? Fuck me?

1359
01:36:40,583 --> 01:36:42,000
- I left him.
- You left him?

1360
01:36:42,083 --> 01:36:44,250
Congratulations, baby,
you're an expert. Huh?

1361
01:36:44,833 --> 01:36:46,958
Do you think I'm a fucking idiot? Huh?

1362
01:36:47,666 --> 01:36:48,875
Am I an arsehole?

1363
01:36:49,541 --> 01:36:52,583
Please. Please. Please. Please. Come on.

1364
01:36:54,166 --> 01:36:57,666
They're little fucking girls.
How am I supposed to do this?

1365
01:36:58,916 --> 01:37:00,750
Joe, I'm feeling dizzy.

1366
01:37:03,958 --> 01:37:06,250
I'm taking them to your mum's.
I can't handle this.

1367
01:37:06,333 --> 01:37:08,166
- No, you're not.
- Yeah. [sniffles]

1368
01:37:09,291 --> 01:37:10,458
You're threatening me?

1369
01:37:11,958 --> 01:37:13,458
That is revenge.

1370
01:37:14,625 --> 01:37:17,000
That's fuck… Lazy.

1371
01:37:17,083 --> 01:37:20,750
You bring them back there, and they're
going to sink into that black shithole.

1372
01:37:20,833 --> 01:37:25,250
All the fucking <i>shit…</i> that I came from.

1373
01:37:26,583 --> 01:37:28,041
I do think you're an arsehole.

1374
01:37:28,125 --> 01:37:29,666
My mother didn't even finish school.

1375
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:31,083
