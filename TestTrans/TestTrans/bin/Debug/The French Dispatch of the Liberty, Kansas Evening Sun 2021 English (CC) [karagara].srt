1
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,406
<i>It began as a holiday.</i>

2
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:19,037
<i>Arthur Howitzer Junior,
college freshman...</i>

3
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,874
<i>eager to escape a bright future
on the Great Plains...</i>

4
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,586
<i>convinced his father, proprietor
of the</i> Liberty, Kansas Evening Sun...

5
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:29,339
<i>to fund his transatlantic passage
as an educational opportunity...</i>

6
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,966
<i>to learn the family business...</i>

7
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,719
<i>through the production of a series of
travelogue columns...</i>

8
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:38,098
<i>to be published for local readers
in the Sunday</i> Picnic <i>magazine.</i>

9
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,863
<i>Over the next ten years,
he assembled a team...</i>

10
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,407
<i>of the best expatriate journalists
of his time...</i>

11
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:58,827
<i>and transformed
</i>Picnic <i>into</i> The French Dispatch...

12
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,999
<i>a factual weekly report
on the subjects of world politics...</i>

13
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:08,377
<i>the arts, high and low, fashion,
fancy cuisine, fine drink...</i>

14
00:02:08,544 --> 00:02:12,966
<i>and diverse stories of
human interests set in faraway quartiers.</i>

15
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,221
<i>He brought the world to Kansas.</i>

16
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:25,771
<i>His writers line the spines
of every good American library.</i>

17
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,565
<i>Berensen...</i>

18
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,109
<i>Sazerac...</i>

19
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,570
<i>Krementz...</i>

20
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,782
<i>Roebuck Wright.</i>

21
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,826
<i>One reporter known
as the best living writer...</i>

22
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,287
<i>in quality of sentences per minute.</i>

23
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,040
<i>One who never completed
a single article...</i>

24
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:48,335
<i>but haunted the halls
cheerily for three decades.</i>

25
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:53,257
<i>One privately blind writer who wrote
keenly through the eyes of others.</i>

26
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:58,053
<i>The uncontested crackerjack
of grammatical expertise.</i>

27
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,975
<i>Cover illustrations by Hermès Jones.</i>

28
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,352
<i>Famously gracious with his writers...</i>

29
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,106
<i>Arthur Junior was less courteous
with the rest of the magazine's staff.</i>

30
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:11,024
Oh, no, what's that?

31
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,609
I need a turkey.

32
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,737
Stuffed and roasted on a table
with all the trimmings and pilgrims!

33
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:19,074
<i>His fiscal management system
was convoluted but functional.</i>

34
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,994
Give her 150 francs a week
for the next 15 years...

35
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,955
against five American cents per word,
minus expenses.

36
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:29,042
<i>His most repeated literary advice,
perhaps apocryphal, was simply this...</i>

37
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:32,671
Just try to make it sound
like you wrote it that way on purpose.

38
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:37,050
<i>His return to Liberty comes precisely
50 years after his departure,</i>

39
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:39,303
<i>on the occasion of his funeral...</i>

40
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,430
<i>by which time the magazine's
circulation exceeds...</i>

41
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:44,433
<i>half a million subscribers
in 50 countries.</i>

42
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:48,979
<i>A willow hamper containing umpteen pins,
plaques, and official citations...</i>

43
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:51,481
<i>of the highest order
is buried at his side,</i>

44
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,192
<i>along with an Andretti Ribbon-mate...</i>

45
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,987
<i>and a ream of triple bond,
Egyptian cotton typing stock.</i>

46
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,869
<i>He received an Editor's burial.</i>

47
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,290
<i>In his will, he stipulated that...</i>

48
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,792
<i>immediately upon his death, quote...</i>

49
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,795
<i>The presses
will be dismantled and liquefied.</i>

50
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:16,548
<i>The editorial offices will be vacated
and sold.</i>

51
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:19,885
<i>The staff will be paid ample bonuses
and released from their contracts...</i>

52
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:23,055
<i>and the publication of the magazine
will permanently cease.</i>

53
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:24,848
<i>Thus...</i>

54
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:29,186
<i>the publisher's obituary will also serve
as that of this publication.</i>

55
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:33,774
<i>All home delivery readers will, of course,
be refunded, pro rata...</i>

56
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,818
<i>for the unfulfilled portion of
their subscriptions.</i>

57
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,407
<i>His epitaph will be taken verbatim
from the stenciled shingle...</i>

58
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,826
<i>fixed above the door of his inner office.</i>

59
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,703
Berensen's article.
<i>The Concrete Masterpiece.</i>

60
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,539
Three dangling participles,
two split infinitives...

61
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,582
and nine spelling errors
in the first sentence alone.

62
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,584
Some of those are intentional.

63
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:55,546
The Krementz story,
<i>Revisions to a Manifesto.</i>

64
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,340
We asked for 2,500 words,
and she came in at 14,000...

65
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:00,717
plus footnotes, endnotes,
a glossary, and two epilogues.

66
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,553
It's one of her best.

67
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:05,722
-Sazerac?
-Impossible to fact-check.

68
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,851
He changes all the names and only writes
about hobos, pimps, and junkies.

69
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,561
These are his people.

70
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:12,896
How about Roebuck Wright?

71
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,982
His door's locked,
but I could hear the keys clacking.

72
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,149
Don't rush him.

73
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,485
The question is, who gets killed?

74
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,821
There's one piece too many
even if we print another double-issue...

75
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,990
which we can't afford
under any circumstances.

76
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,412
A message from the foreman.
One hour to press.

77
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,372
You're fired.

78
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,457
Really?

79
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,169
Don't cry in my office.

80
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,929
Shrink the masthead, cut some ads,
and tell the foreman to buy more paper.

81
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,223
I'm not killing anybody.

82
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,102
<i>Good writers. He coddled them.</i>

83
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,022
<i>He coaxed them.
He ferociously protected them.</i>

84
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,982
What do you think?

85
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,233
For myself?

86
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,361
I would start with Mr. Sazerac.

87
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:03,780
<i>These were his people.</i>

88
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,384
<i>Ennui rises suddenly on a Monday.</i>

89
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,372
Through the time machine
of poetic license...

90
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,290
let us take a sight-seeing tour.

91
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:59,419
A day in Ennui over
the course of 250 years.

92
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:03,173
<i>The great city began as a cluster
of tradesman's villages.</i>

93
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:05,968
<i>Only the names remain unchanged.</i>

94
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,470
<i>The Bootblack District.</i>

95
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,433
<i>The Bricklayer's Quarter.</i>

96
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:18,021
<i>The Butcher's Arcade.</i>

97
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,735
<i>Pick-pocket Cul-de-Sac.</i>

98
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,657
On this site, a fabled market...

99
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,535
vending all forms of
victuals and comestibles...

100
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:35,622
under a single vast,
glass-and-cast-iron canopy...

101
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,875
later demolished, as you can see...

102
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:42,171
in favor of a multi-level shopping center
and parking structure.

103
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,631
Like every living city...

104
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:48,552
Ennui supports a menagerie
of vermin and scavengers.

105
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:53,640
<i>The rats which colonized
its subterranean railroad.</i>

106
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:58,270
<i>The cats
which colonized its slanty rooftops.</i>

107
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:02,900
<i>The</i> anguillettes <i>which colonized
its shallow drainage canals.</i>

108
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,779
<i>After receiving the Host,
marauding choirboys...</i>

109
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:11,325
<i>half-drunk on the Blood of Christ,
stalk unwary pensioners...</i>

110
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,160
<i>and seek havoc.</i>

111
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:17,664
<i>In the Flop Quarter, students.</i>

112
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:20,542
<i>Hungry, restless, reckless.</i>

113
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,544
<i>In the Hovel District...</i>

114
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,004
<i>old people.</i>

115
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:30,636
<i>Old people who have failed.</i>

116
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,140
<i>The automobile.</i>

117
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,518
A mixed blessing. On the one hand...

118
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,687
the honking, skidding, speeding,
sputtering, and backfiring.

119
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:44,191
The emission of toxic fumes
and filthy exhaust-pollution...

120
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:47,819
the dangerous accidents,
the constant traffic, the high...

121
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:49,530
Fuck!

122
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,115
<i>Department of Local Statistics.</i>

123
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:55,494
<i>Average rainfall, 750 millimeters.</i>

124
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:59,373
<i>Average snowfall, 190,000 flakes.</i>

125
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,960
<i>Eight-point-two-five bodies
are pulled from the Blasé river each week.</i>

126
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:06,004
<i>A figure which remains consistent despite
population growth...</i>

127
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,215
<i>and advances in health and hygiene.</i>

128
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:12,386
<i>As the sun sets,
a medley of unregistered streetwalkers...</i>

129
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:16,515
<i>and gigolos replaces the day's
delivery boys and shopkeepers...</i>

130
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:20,269
<i>and an air of promiscuous calm
saturates the hour.</i>

131
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,147
<i>What sounds will punctuate the night?</i>

132
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,317
<i>And what mysteries will they foretell?</i>

133
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:31,029
<i>Perhaps the doubtful
old maxim speaks true.</i>

134
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,034
<i>All grand beauties...</i>

135
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,204
<i>withhold their deepest secrets.</i>

136
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:47,004
"Rats, vermin, gigolos, streetwalkers."

137
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,798
You don't think it's almost
too seedy this time?

138
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,633
-No, I don't.
-For decent people.

139
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,343
It's supposed to be charming.

140
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,346
"Pick-pockets, dead bodies,
prisons, urinals..."

141
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,432
You don't want to add a flower shop...

142
00:09:58,599 --> 00:09:59,766
-or an art museum?
-No, I don't.

143
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,393
A pretty place of some kind?

144
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,228
I hate flowers.

145
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:11,028
You could cut the second half
of the second paragraph, by the way.

146
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,447
You already repeat it later.

147
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:15,782
Okay.

148
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,430
<i>We take as the subject
of tonight's lecture...</i>

149
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,974
the great painter at the vanguard...

150
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,602
and heart of
the French Splatter-school Action-group...

151
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,063
Mr. Moses Rosenthaler.

152
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,190
Widely celebrated, as you know...

153
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:57,486
for the bold dramatic style,
and colossal scale of his middle-period...

154
00:12:57,653 --> 00:13:01,281
in particular, of course,
the polyptych-tableaux known as...

155
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:05,035
<i>Ten Reinforced Cement
Aggregate Load-Bearing Murals.</i>

156
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,996
He remains, in my opinion,
the most eloquent...

157
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:13,794
and certainly, the loudest artistic voice
of his rowdy generation.

158
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:17,381
How does this pivotal piece
come to find its way...

159
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,843
into its unique position
as a permanent installation here...

160
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,678
at the Clampette Collection?

161
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,181
The story begins in a mess hall.

162
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:33,230
<i>The exhibition,
</i>Ashtrays, Pots, and Macramé...

163
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:36,066
<i>a group show of handicrafts
by amateur artisans...</i>

164
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:39,319
<i>incarcerated in the lunatic section
of the Ennui Prison-Asylum...</i>

165
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,739
<i>might, perhaps, have been omitted
from the annals of art history...</i>

166
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:46,535
<i>had it not been for the inclusion
in its number of a small painting...</i>

167
00:13:46,702 --> 00:13:49,288
<i>by Mr. Rosenthaler,
who was, at that time...</i>

168
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:52,332
<i>serving a 50-year sentence
for the crime of double homicide...</i>

169
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,460
<i>and the observation of that work
by a fellow inmate...</i>

170
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:58,463
<i>the Levantine art dealer
Mr. Julian Cadazio...</i>

171
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,674
<i>who, by fateful coincidence,
happened to be imprisoned...</i>

172
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:04,344
<i>in the adjoining annex on a charge of
second-degree sales tax evasion.</i>

173
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,471
Guard.

174
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,895
Who painted this picture?

175
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,444
Citizen 7524.

176
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:25,908
I believe that unit designates maximum
security for the demented and deranged.

177
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,911
Are you able to provide me an escort
and a Friendly Visit Stamp...

178
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,704
for immediate use?

179
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,771
<i>Simone, Naked, Cell Block J, Hobby Room.</i>

180
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,397
I wanna buy it.

181
00:14:58,315 --> 00:14:59,316
Why?

182
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,026
Because I like it.

183
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:03,403
It's not for sale.

184
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:04,738
Yes, it is.

185
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,616
-No, it isn't.
-Yes, it is.

186
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,034
-No, it isn't.
-Yes, it is.

187
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:10,702
-No, it isn't.
-It is, yes. It is.

188
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,872
All artists sell all their work.
It's what makes you an artist.

189
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:17,042
Selling it.If you don't wish
to sell it, don't paint it.

190
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,795
Question is, what's your price?

191
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,383
50 cigarettes.

192
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,260
Actually, make it 75.

193
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,638
Why do you keep looking at that guard?

194
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,895
She's Simone.

195
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,407
I don't want to buy this
important piece for 50 cigarettes.

196
00:15:48,574 --> 00:15:50,701
-75.
-Or 75 of prison currency.

197
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:53,954
I want to pay you 250,000 francs
in legal French tender.

198
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,539
Do we agree on the sale?

199
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:04,798
I can only offer a deposit of...

200
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:08,594
83 <i>centimes,</i> one candied chestnut,
and four cigarettes.

201
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,804
Everything I have at this
present moment in time.

202
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:13,223
However, if you'll accept my
signatory voucher, I assure you...

203
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,725
a check for the outstanding balance

204
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,351
will be remitted to your account
within 90 days.

205
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:17,895
Where do you bank?

206
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:20,272
Never mind.

207
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,922
How'd you learn to do it, by the way?

208
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:46,507
Paint this kind of picture.

209
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:50,135
Also, who'd you murder,
and how crazy are you, really?

210
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:52,888
I need background information
so that we can do a book about you.

211
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,806
It makes you more important.

212
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,100
Who are you...

213
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,355
Moses Rosenthaler?

214
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,944
Born rich, the son
of a Jewish-Mexican horse rancher...

215
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:12,241
Miguel Sebastian Maria
Moisés de Rosenthaler...

216
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:16,369
trained at the <i>École des Antiquités
</i>at significant family expense.

217
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:19,122
But, by the end of his youth...

218
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:20,999
he had shed all the luxuries...

219
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:24,377
of his comfortable background
and replaced them with...

220
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,463
<i>Squalor.</i>

221
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:30,467
<i>Hunger.</i>

222
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:34,596
<i>Loneliness.</i>

223
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,351
<i>Physical danger.</i>

224
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,732
<i>Mental illness.</i>

225
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:49,862
<i>And, of course...</i>

226
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:52,990
<i>Criminal violence.</i>

227
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,637
<i>He did not pick up a brush
during the first decade...</i>

228
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:17,806
<i>of his long prison sentence.</i>

229
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,782
Permission to sign up for
activity privileges, <i>gardienne.</i>

230
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:19,451
This thing?

231
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:29,086
What do you mean?

232
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,420
Tell the group about yourself.

233
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,381
-I don't wanna do that.
-It's mandatory.

234
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:34,091
-They know me already.
-That's not the point.

235
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:36,552
-I haven't even prepared a speech.
-Say something.

236
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,565
Well, I've been here
3,647 days and nights.

237
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:55,279
Another 14,603 to go.

238
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:59,908
I drink 14 pints of mouthwash rations
per week.

239
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:02,452
At that rate...

240
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,913
I think I'm going to
poison myself to death...

241
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,749
before I ever get to see the world again,

242
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:11,461
which makes me feel...

243
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:13,881
very sad.

244
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:16,800
I gotta change my program.

245
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:19,511
I gotta go in a new direction.

246
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:23,932
Anything I can do to keep my hands busy,
I'm gonna do.

247
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:27,853
Otherwise...

248
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:31,648
I think maybe it's gonna be a suicide.

249
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:42,534
And that's why I signed up
for clay pottery and basket weaving.

250
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,455
My name is Moses.

251
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:48,957
Take a pew.

252
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,556
What's your name, <i>gardienne?</i>

253
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:05,849
Simone.

254
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:15,984
<i>Certain women do gravitate
toward incarcerated men.</i>

255
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:17,903
<i>It's a recognized condition.</i>

256
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:21,365
Something about the captivity of others...

257
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:24,701
enhances the experience
of their own freedom.

258
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,995
I assure you, it's erotic.

259
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:29,039
Look at her, by the way.

260
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:30,958
Born into quasi-serfdom...

261
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,668
16 brothers and sisters.

262
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,711
Illiterate until she was 20.

263
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:37,130
Now, a woman of considerable property.

264
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,465
Radiant.

265
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:39,633
Good God.

266
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,884
Wrong slide. That's me.

267
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:47,057
Simone, of course, refused all
Rosenthaler's entreaties of marriage...

268
00:21:47,224 --> 00:21:49,351
which, we are told, were frequent...

269
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:51,770
and marvelously enthusiastic.

270
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:55,232
I wanna say it as simple as I can.

271
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,901
To try to shape it into words.

272
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:00,279
The feelings in my heart.

273
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:02,614
-I don't love you.
-I love you.

274
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:04,032
What?

275
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:05,576
I don't love you.

276
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,160
Already?

277
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:08,328
Already what?

278
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:09,913
Already how do you know that?

279
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,665
How can you be sure? It's so quick.

280
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:13,166
I'm sure.

281
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:15,169
Ouch.

282
00:22:15,878 --> 00:22:17,129
That hurts me.

283
00:22:17,296 --> 00:22:20,632
The cruelty of it. The cold-bloodedness.

284
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,510
You said what you wanted to say.
I tried to stop you. That's it.

285
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,971
I said part of what I wanted to say.

286
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:28,348
I was in the middle of it. There's more.

287
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:29,808
No.

288
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:32,895
-No what? Will you...
-No.

289
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:34,062
-Will you marry me?
-No.

290
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:02,716
I'm gonna need art supplies.

291
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:07,012
Canvas, stretchers, brushes, turpentine.

292
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:08,722
What do you want to paint?

293
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,557
The future.

294
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:16,396
Which is you.

295
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:21,026
Widely not considered
a great connoisseur...

296
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:24,112
Julian Cadazio, nevertheless,
had an eye for something,

297
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:27,032
and he did us all a very good turn...

298
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:29,993
when the hour he was released
from prison...

299
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:38,043
We're done with flowers and fruit bowls.

300
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:40,671
We're finished with beaches and seascapes.

301
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,757
We're getting out of armor, rugs,
and tapestries, too.

302
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:45,717
I found something new.

303
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:57,688
Modern art?

304
00:23:57,896 --> 00:24:00,148
Modern art. Our specialty, starting now.

305
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:01,817
-I don't get it.
-Of course you don't.

306
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:03,068
-Am I too old?
-Of course you are.

307
00:24:03,235 --> 00:24:05,279
-Why is this good?
-It isn't good. Wrong idea.

308
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:06,530
That's no answer.

309
00:24:06,697 --> 00:24:08,532
My point. You see the girl in it?

310
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,783
No.

311
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,952
Trust me, she's there.

312
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:16,665
One way to tell if a modern artist
actually knows what he's doing...

313
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:20,169
is to get him to paint you a horse
or a flower or a sinking battleship...

314
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:22,004
or something that's
actually supposed to look like...

315
00:24:22,171 --> 00:24:24,214
the thing that it's actually
supposed to look like.

316
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,717
Can he do it? Look at this.

317
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:29,845
Drawn in 45 seconds right in front of me
with a burnt matchstick.

318
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:32,181
A perfect sparrow. That's excellent.

319
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:33,348
May I keep it?

320
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:34,808
Don't be stupid. Of course not.

321
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:38,020
The point is, he could paint
this beautifully if he wanted...

322
00:24:38,187 --> 00:24:40,272
but he thinks this is better.

323
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:42,399
And I think I sort of agree with him.

324
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:46,486
<i>Simone, Naked, Cell Block J, Hobby Room
</i>is probably a masterpiece...

325
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:49,656
worth a significant, even exorbitant,
sum of money.

326
00:24:50,574 --> 00:24:51,742
But not yet.

327
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:54,786
The desire must be created.

328
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:58,707
How long is he in for?

329
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,970
Mr. Rosenthaler...

330
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:15,098
why should we put you back on the street?

331
00:25:16,225 --> 00:25:18,602
Because it was an accident, Your Honor.

332
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:21,980
I didn't intend to kill anybody.

333
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:25,776
You decapitated two bartenders
with a meat saw.

334
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:32,616
The first bartender was an accident.

335
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,911
The second one was self-defense.

336
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:38,956
Well, be that as it may...

337
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:42,167
what demonstration of genuine remorse,
or, at the very least...

338
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:44,920
regret can you offer
for beheading these men?

339
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:50,759
They had it coming.

340
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:53,220
-I beg your pardon?
-Forgive me.

341
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:57,266
Is there a part of this ritual
where you ask...

342
00:25:57,432 --> 00:26:00,018
if anybody has something
to say before it's too late?

343
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:01,436
Like, at a wedding.

344
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:03,647
-No.
-I'll be brief.

345
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:10,529
We all know this man is a murderer.

346
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:14,283
Totally guilty of first-degree homicide,
any way you slice it.

347
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:15,492
That's a given.

348
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:18,996
However, he's also that rare
once-in-a-generation guy...

349
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:22,666
that you hear about, but never get
the chance to discover for yourself.

350
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:25,752
An artistic genius.

351
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:27,963
Surely, there ought to be
a double standard

352
00:26:28,046 --> 00:26:29,423
for this sort of predicament.

353
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:33,635
Supposedly, he's a psychotic, by the way.
That's not his fault.

354
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:36,263
Respectfully, I submit...

355
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:40,809
maybe we could think up
some other way to punish him?

356
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:44,688
<i>Rosenthaler's right to petition
for parole was permanently revoked...</i>

357
00:26:44,855 --> 00:26:46,440
<i>for the duration of his sentence.</i>

358
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,359
No further questions.

359
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,697
Nevertheless, Cadazio and his uncles were
unanimous in their decision...

360
00:26:53,864 --> 00:26:56,700
to promote the artist
as his exclusive brokers...

361
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:58,660
throughout the free world.

362
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:03,957
Simone<i> travelled far and wide.</i>

363
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,419
<i>The Ennui Salon.</i>

364
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,715
<i>The Royal Exposition.</i>

365
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:15,928
<i>The International Pavilion
at the Liberty, Kansas State Fair...</i>

366
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:18,222
<i>which was very nearly
burned to the ground.</i>

367
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:21,058
<i>In short, the picture was a sensation.</i>

368
00:27:23,602 --> 00:27:26,104
<i>Even the artist's all but forgotten
earlier work...</i>

369
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:30,025
<i>inspired wildly robust sales
on the secondary market.</i>

370
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:35,322
Meanwhile, Rosenthaler
continued to work in confinement.

371
00:27:35,781 --> 00:27:39,284
Strikingly, the artist favored
raw materials sourced...

372
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:42,246
exclusively from within
the prison-asylum domain.

373
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:44,665
<i>Powdered eggs.</i>

374
00:27:45,123 --> 00:27:46,542
<i>Pigeon blood.</i>

375
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:48,418
<i>Shackle grease.</i>

376
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:50,462
<i>Coal, cork, and dung.</i>

377
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:52,089
<i>Fire, of course.</i>

378
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:54,383
<i>Bright yellow scullery soap.</i>

379
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:57,427
<i>And fresh cream of millet
as a binding agent.</i>

380
00:27:58,804 --> 00:28:01,056
<i>Simone liked to stand still.</i>

381
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:04,101
<i>Indeed, she was Olympian in her ability...</i>

382
00:28:04,268 --> 00:28:07,354
<i>to hold extremely challenging positions
for extended periods of time.</i>

383
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:11,358
<i>She exhibited very little vulnerability
to extremes of heat or cold.</i>

384
00:28:11,483 --> 00:28:14,278
<i>After even the most adverse
forms of exposure...</i>

385
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:18,448
<i>her skin remained unburned,
unblemished, un-goose-pimpled.</i>

386
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:19,658
<i>Another tidbit.</i>

387
00:28:19,825 --> 00:28:22,661
<i>She genuinely enjoyed
the smell of turpentine...</i>

388
00:28:22,828 --> 00:28:26,999
<i>and in later years actually wore it
in the application of her toilet.</i>

389
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,460
<i>She was more than a muse.</i>

390
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:37,009
Throw the switch.

391
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:48,562
Throw the switch, you cocksucker.

392
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,903
What's wrong with you? Go back to work.

393
00:28:56,862 --> 00:28:58,572
I can't.

394
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:00,949
I won't. It's too hard.

395
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:03,660
It's torture.

396
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:07,414
I'm literally a tortured artist.

397
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:11,835
Poor baby.

398
00:29:12,628 --> 00:29:13,629
Get out.

399
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:31,855
Is that what you want?

400
00:30:09,893 --> 00:30:11,562
What's your problem?

401
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:14,565
I don't know what to paint.

402
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,942
The French Splatter-school Action group.

403
00:30:59,443 --> 00:31:03,113
A dynamic, talented, lusty, slovenly,
alcoholic...

404
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,033
violent pack of creative savages.

405
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:10,120
They inspired and very often...

406
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:13,582
personally attacked each other
for two decades and more.

407
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:15,501
I'll have my drink now.

408
00:31:20,464 --> 00:31:23,175
Remember, in those days, as you know...

409
00:31:23,342 --> 00:31:27,346
it was much more socially acceptable
for a painter or a sculptor...

410
00:31:27,513 --> 00:31:31,350
to hit another fellow
with a chair or even a brick...

411
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:35,437
or walk around with a black eye
or a broken tooth and so on.

412
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,816
Indeed, I'm jumping ahead,
but in my own experience...

413
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:43,529
Rosenthaler could be quite
unpredictably impulsive.

414
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:47,241
Meaning, I refer to the pigment locker
beneath his studio...

415
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:49,409
in the <i>Boulevard des Plombiers,
</i>on one occasion...

416
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:51,745
he grabbed me and put me in there,

417
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:55,249
and inappropriately, sort of,
tried to fuck me...

418
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:57,584
against the wall in the corner
of that pigment locker.

419
00:31:57,751 --> 00:32:01,004
He was crazy. Officially certified.

420
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:13,892
The Cadazios, of course,
represented them all.

421
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:25,946
It's three years later.

422
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:27,906
We've made you
the most famous painter alive...

423
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:30,951
based on one small,
scribbly, overrated picture.

424
00:32:31,118 --> 00:32:32,494
You're an art school course.

425
00:32:32,661 --> 00:32:34,162
You're an encyclopedia entry.

426
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:37,124
Even your disciples have won
and squandered multiple fortunes...

427
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:40,002
yet you refuse to show us
so much as a sketch or a study...

428
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:43,297
for a single new piece
during this entire, protracted period.

429
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:44,965
How long are we meant to wait?

430
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:47,217
Well, don't answer,
because we're not asking.

431
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:50,095
We already printed the invitations.

432
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:51,555
We're coming in.

433
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,016
All of us. The collectors. The critics.

434
00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:56,685
Even your second-rate imitators
we represent who suck up to you...

435
00:32:56,852 --> 00:32:59,438
and smuggle you goodies and probably
turn out to be better than you are.

436
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:01,690
The bribes alone
are going to be outrageous,

437
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:02,983
as these guards can assure you.

438
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:04,568
But we're gonna pay 'em.

439
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:06,403
So, finish it, whatever it is.

440
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:08,780
The show is in two weeks.

441
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:18,665
She thinks it's ready, by the way.

442
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:20,250
It's ready.

443
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:24,796
I could use another year.

444
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:31,720
My employer, at that time,
received the intriguing summons...

445
00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:33,764
by rapid-priority wire.

446
00:33:33,931 --> 00:33:37,559
I refer, of course,
to Upshur "Maw" Clampette.

447
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,854
Astute collector of antiquities.

448
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:42,648
Great friend to the <i>avant-garde.</i>

449
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:46,109
Her collection, even in its infancy,
was well-known and important...

450
00:33:46,276 --> 00:33:49,947
as was her residence,
Ingo Steen's first American commission...

451
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:53,242
informally known as the Doorstop House.

452
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:58,080
It was my duty, and I may say,
my privilege to catalogue...

453
00:33:58,247 --> 00:34:01,583
archive, and advise, although she did
whatever the hell she wanted...

454
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,794
no matter what you told her, anyway.

455
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:08,841
<i>Thus, we began the long journey
from Liberty to Ennui.</i>

456
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:12,803
<i>My dear Mrs. Clampette, Maw, if I may,</i>

457
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:16,014
<i>please join us for the first display of
Mr. Moses Rosenthaler's...</i>

458
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:17,724
<i>extremely exciting new work,</i>

459
00:34:17,808 --> 00:34:19,851
<i>which I, myself,
have not yet been permitted to see.</i>

460
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:22,813
<i>In order to facilitate the viewing
in a timely fashion...</i>

461
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,313
<i>it may prove necessary for us</i>

462
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:26,567
<i>to surreptitiously gain access
to the facility...</i>

463
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:28,735
<i>where the artist currently resides.</i>

464
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:31,655
<i>Please rely on my operatives to organize
any and all details...</i>

465
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:33,447
<i>and preparations for your visit.</i>

466
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:37,578
<i>Caution, do not bring matches, lighters,
or sharp objects of any kind.</i>

467
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,956
<i>We await your confirmation
with cheerful anticipation.</i>

468
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:45,210
<i>Yours most truly, Cadazio Uncles
and Nephew Galerie concern.</i>

469
00:34:48,797 --> 00:34:51,925
<i>The paddy wagon collected us directly
after the night's final round...</i>

470
00:34:52,092 --> 00:34:53,135
<i>of working girls and revelers</i>

471
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:55,971
<i>were delivered to the drunk tank
at 3:00 a.m.</i>

472
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:44,520
Moses, are you here?

473
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:49,441
Any words of introduction?

474
00:35:49,608 --> 00:35:53,028
Or perhaps, a welcome to our
wonderful guests, some of whom...

475
00:35:53,195 --> 00:35:55,614
have traveled a great distance
to come see your work, I hope?

476
00:35:55,781 --> 00:35:58,534
Or, alternatively, just, I don't know.

477
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:00,202
Hello?

478
00:36:03,413 --> 00:36:05,457
Quiet, please!

479
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:07,709
Quiet, please!

480
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,841
I did it. It's good! This is historic.

481
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:15,717
Open the champagne! I did it.

482
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:16,885
Music!

483
00:36:23,308 --> 00:36:24,643
Why are you sitting in a wheelchair
like an invalid?

484
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,687
You should be dancing on the tables!
It's a triumph!

485
00:36:32,025 --> 00:36:33,443
Do you like it?

486
00:36:34,611 --> 00:36:36,238
Do I like it?

487
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:37,865
Yes.

488
00:36:44,288 --> 00:36:46,290
Look at Maw, she's mesmerized.

489
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,335
This here's a fresco, t'weren't it?

490
00:36:50,502 --> 00:36:53,255
Precisely. He's a Renaissance master
of the highest order.

491
00:36:53,422 --> 00:36:55,299
He mines the same vein
as Piperno Pierluigi

492
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:56,383
when he illuminated...

493
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,636
<i>The Christ Before God's Heavenly Altar
</i>in 1565.

494
00:36:59,803 --> 00:37:02,472
Maw, nobody has an eye
for things nobody has ever seen...

495
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:04,641
like Maw Clampette of Liberty, Kansas.

496
00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:07,144
We should be ashamed to even gather
in her presence.

497
00:37:07,311 --> 00:37:08,937
Why the fuck did she say fresco?

498
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:12,774
Are they painted into the walls?

499
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:15,694
Oh, no. What has he done?

500
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,155
You fucking asshole.

501
00:37:18,363 --> 00:37:19,489
Are you seeing this? Look at this!

502
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:21,658
-Well, I think it's utterly wonderful.
-It's crucial!

503
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:24,369
It's probably a turning point in
the evolution of human pictography.

504
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:27,706
Scratched and plastered into a reinforced
cement aggregate gymnasium.

505
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:29,333
He even painted onto the radiators!

506
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:33,170
Maybe one of them restoration fellers out
at the <i>Fondazione dell'Arte Classico...</i>

507
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:35,297
could figure a way to rustle
them pictures loose.

508
00:37:35,464 --> 00:37:37,257
We're in a maximum-security prison, Maw.

509
00:37:37,424 --> 00:37:38,425
It's federal property.

510
00:37:38,592 --> 00:37:41,011
Even to begin the bureaucratic nightmare
would require years...

511
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,431
of negotiation with a team of highly-paid,
arrogant, obnoxious advocates.

512
00:37:44,598 --> 00:37:46,725
I don't even know how you'd peel them off.
It's a fresco.

513
00:37:47,226 --> 00:37:50,229
Hey! It's a fresco!

514
00:37:51,188 --> 00:37:52,189
So what?

515
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:54,775
Can you even begin to fathom
the shit-ton of money...

516
00:37:54,942 --> 00:37:57,819
my uncles and I have squandered
to get to this point of no return?

517
00:37:58,237 --> 00:37:59,363
Look at them!

518
00:38:00,948 --> 00:38:01,949
You've ruined us!

519
00:38:02,032 --> 00:38:03,492
Does it mean nothing to you?

520
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:04,910
I thought you liked it.

521
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:08,080
I think it stinks!

522
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:10,374
Get out of that wheelchair!

523
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:13,085
I'm going to kick your ass
up and down this hobby room!

524
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,173
Don't growl at me,
you convicted murderer.

525
00:38:18,507 --> 00:38:23,095
You homicidal, suicidal,
psychopathic, no-talent drunk!

526
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:49,663
Why didn't you tell me, <i>gardienne?</i>

527
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:52,833
Because you would've stopped him.

528
00:38:59,715 --> 00:39:01,175
We have to accept it.

529
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:03,260
His need to fail is more powerful...

530
00:39:03,427 --> 00:39:06,054
than our strongest desires
to help him succeed.

531
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:08,265
I give up. He's defeated us.

532
00:39:08,432 --> 00:39:10,726
-He's defeated us.
-Sad, but there it is.

533
00:39:12,311 --> 00:39:16,148
Anyway, at least,
he finished the motherfucker.

534
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:20,485
It is, perhaps, the most interesting
contemplation of peripheral vision...

535
00:39:20,652 --> 00:39:22,196
I've ever seen.

536
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:31,747
Well done, Moses.

537
00:39:41,173 --> 00:39:44,843
Well done, Moses.
This has a greatness to it.

538
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:49,097
If you plastered it deep enough,
it may last.

539
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:52,434
We'll come and see it again one day.

540
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:54,061
God willing.

541
00:39:54,353 --> 00:39:56,772
You'll already still be here, of course.

542
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:00,901
It's all Simone.

543
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:19,503
<i>At that moment, they were both aware of
Simone's intention...</i>

544
00:40:19,753 --> 00:40:20,838
<i>to leave her position</i>

545
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:23,048
<i>at the Ennui Prison-Asylum
the following day...</i>

546
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,759
<i>endowed with funds
provided by the Cadazios...</i>

547
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:29,930
<i>as compensation for her work
as Rosenthaler's model and muse.</i>

548
00:40:31,056 --> 00:40:33,642
<i>She was reunited with the estranged child
to whom...</i>

549
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:35,435
<i>she had given birth in her youth,</i>

550
00:40:35,602 --> 00:40:38,188
<i>and the two never again lived apart.</i>

551
00:40:39,189 --> 00:40:41,900
<i>She and Rosenthaler
maintained a regular correspondence...</i>

552
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:43,861
<i>for the rest of the artist's life.</i>

553
00:40:49,366 --> 00:40:51,827
Mrs. Clampette would like
to put the piece on hold.

554
00:40:53,245 --> 00:40:54,246
The half-sticker?

555
00:40:54,413 --> 00:40:55,581
Yes, please.

556
00:40:55,747 --> 00:40:57,249
Should she choose to finalize the sale...

557
00:40:57,416 --> 00:41:00,127
will this amount be acceptable to you
and your uncles?

558
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:05,090
Can we get a deposit?

559
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:08,927
Maw? An advance against the total sum?

560
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:13,891
Tell them stingy Frenchmen
I ain't making no promises.

561
00:41:14,057 --> 00:41:16,768
Ten Reinforced Cement
Aggregate Load-Bearing Murals...

562
00:41:16,935 --> 00:41:19,438
<i>was to remain on hold under the name
Upshur Clampette...</i>

563
00:41:19,605 --> 00:41:21,565
<i>for the subsequent 20 years.</i>

564
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,321
Which prisoners?

565
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:34,745
Tell them we don't bribe
rapists and pickpockets. It's unethical.

566
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:37,873
Besides, I didn't bring an additional
6,000,000 francs in small bills.

567
00:41:44,755 --> 00:41:45,923
How'd you get out there?

568
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,883
What do we do?

569
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:49,384
Lock the door.

570
00:41:58,644 --> 00:42:01,188
<i>In the aftermath, 72 prisoners...</i>

571
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:03,148
<i>and six members
of the French Splatter-school</i>

572
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:05,817
<i>lay dead or mortally wounded.</i>

573
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:09,071
<i>Moses Rosenthaler,
for acts of extreme valor...</i>

574

<i>which saved the lives of nine guards,
22 distinguished visitors...</i>

<i>and the Ministers
of Culture and Urbanity...</i>

576
00:42:15,744 --> 00:42:19,039
<i>received his freedom
with probation for life.</i>

577
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:24,002
<i>And was decorated

578
00:42:30,676 --> 00:42:34,471
<i>One score later, as per
Maw Clampette's detailed instructions...</i>

579
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:38,392
<i>Cadazio and his own nephews arranged for

586

at a beach club
on the North Atlantic coast?

588
00:43:19,016 --> 00:43:20,893
Because I had to go there to write it.

"Breakfast, lunch, dinner, laundry,

Don't ask me to be indiscreet about
what happened between me and Moses...

593
00:43:33,155 --> 00:43:35,657
at a seaside inn 20 years ago.
We were lovers.

594
00:43:35,824 --> 00:43:37,492
I went back to remember.

595
00:43:37,951 --> 00:43:39,203
On my dime.

596
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:40,495
Yes, please.

597
00:43:42,456 --> 00:43:43,665

<i>The protest which ended in a stalemate...</i>

605

<i>...gave the superficial appearance

thus far, fails to appear.</i>

623
00:45:23,432 --> 00:45:24,725
<i>For this, I am grateful.</i>

624
00:45:24,892 --> 00:45:27,102
<i>Had not been informed of his invitation
in first place.</i>

625
00:45:27,269 --> 00:45:30,230
We didn't mean to offend you. We're sorry.

626
00:45:30,397 --> 00:45:33,567
We thought you might decline
the invitation if we warned you.

627
00:45:33,734 --> 00:45:34,860
-You were right.
-Yeah.

628
00:45:35,027 --> 00:45:37,529
<i>Local news reports aggressive
crowd-control methods</i>

629
00:45:37,613 --> 00:45:39,740
<i>in use on street today. Quote...</i>

630
00:45:39,907 --> 00:45:42,284
Just give him a chance.
He's very intelligent.

631
00:45:42,951 --> 00:45:44,745
So, how long has it been
since what's-his-name?

632
00:45:44,912 --> 00:45:45,996
I know you mean well.

633
00:45:46,163 --> 00:45:49,458
<i>"It begins with a prickly tingling
of the exposed skin."</i>

634
00:45:54,213 --> 00:45:55,672
I'm not an old maid.

635
00:45:56,298 --> 00:45:57,299
We don't think that.

636
00:45:58,175 --> 00:45:59,176
Of course you're not.

637
00:45:59,259 --> 00:46:02,513
<i>"Then, a reddening and swelling
of the orbital muscles."</i>

638
00:46:02,888 --> 00:46:04,097
Take me at my word.

639
00:46:04,556 --> 00:46:06,308
I live by myself on purpose.

640
00:46:06,517 --> 00:46:08,560
I prefer relationships that end.

641
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:11,688
I deliberately choose to have
neither husband nor children.

642
00:46:11,855 --> 00:46:15,984
The two greatest deterrents to any woman's
attempt to live by and for writing.

643
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:18,278
-Why are we crying?
-Because it's sad.

644
00:46:18,904 --> 00:46:19,947
We don't want you to be alone.

645
00:46:20,113 --> 00:46:21,532
Loneliness is a kind of poverty.

646
00:46:21,698 --> 00:46:23,075
I'm not sad. My eyes hurt.

647
00:46:23,242 --> 00:46:24,952
There's something wrong
with your apartment.

648
00:46:25,118 --> 00:46:28,622
<i>"Finally, a barrage of searing pain
as snot pours from the nostrils...</i>

649
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:30,415
<i>"and the throat spasms and constricts."</i>

650
00:46:30,582 --> 00:46:31,583
Don't breathe.

651
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,056
I'm naked, Mrs. Krementz.

652
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:48,100
I can see that.

653
00:46:48,267 --> 00:46:50,102
-Why are you crying?
-Tear gas.

654
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:51,353
Also...

655
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:54,356
I suppose I'm sad.

656
00:46:56,859 --> 00:46:59,152
Please turn away.
I feel shy about my new muscles.

657
00:47:03,949 --> 00:47:06,159
Go tell your parents you're home.
They're worried.

658
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:08,287
I'm expected back on the barricades.

659
00:47:08,453 --> 00:47:09,872
I didn't see any barricades.

660
00:47:10,038 --> 00:47:12,457
Well, we're still constructing them.

661
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,543
What are you writing?

662
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:15,961
A manifesto.

663
00:47:16,128 --> 00:47:18,046
I told them not to invite Paul,
by the way.

664
00:47:18,213 --> 00:47:20,674
Maybe you're sad,
but you don't seem lonely to me.

665
00:47:20,841 --> 00:47:21,842
Exactly!

666
00:47:22,009 --> 00:47:24,469
I saw you at the protest
on top of a bookcase taking notes.

667
00:47:24,845 --> 00:47:27,556
Is there a story in us?
For the people of Kansas.

668
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:28,932
Maybe.

669
00:47:29,016 --> 00:47:30,100
Then you should study our resolutions.

670
00:47:30,267 --> 00:47:33,353
Or, anyway, will you proofread it?
My parents think you're a good writer.

671
00:47:35,063 --> 00:47:36,064
Give it to me.

672
00:47:45,532 --> 00:47:46,867
It's a little damp.

673
00:47:48,076 --> 00:47:49,286
Physically or metaphorically?

674
00:47:49,453 --> 00:47:52,080
Both. Based on the cover
and the first four sentences.

675
00:47:52,247 --> 00:47:53,916
Don't criticize my manifesto.

676
00:47:54,082 --> 00:47:55,292
Oh, you don't want remarks?

677
00:47:55,459 --> 00:47:56,877
I don't need remarks, do I?

678
00:47:57,044 --> 00:47:58,170
I only asked you to proofread it...

679
00:47:58,337 --> 00:48:00,506
'cause I thought you'd be even more
impressed by how good it already is.

680
00:48:00,672 --> 00:48:02,674
Let's start with the typos.

681
00:48:03,342 --> 00:48:06,136
Can the faculty succeed
if the students fail?

682
00:48:06,887 --> 00:48:08,388
It remains to be seen.

683
00:48:09,556 --> 00:48:10,849
-Paul Duval.
-Lucinda Krementz.

684
00:48:11,016 --> 00:48:12,017
How do you do?

685
00:48:13,268 --> 00:48:14,770
Your beard is scratching me.

686
00:48:15,938 --> 00:48:19,483
<i>Unexpected guest finally arrives.
Looks like hell.</i>

687
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:21,360
<i>Describes odyssey across city.</i>

688
00:48:21,693 --> 00:48:23,195
<i>Stalled trains, stalled buses...</i>

689
00:48:23,362 --> 00:48:26,573
<i>broken windows, paving stones
flying in all directions.</i>

690
00:48:27,741 --> 00:48:29,743
Anyway, we're here.

691
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,287
The famous Lucinda. Hello.

692
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,123
I did not know you were coming.
They did not tell me.

693
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:37,292
This is not an official meeting.

694
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:44,341
<i>Good evening.</i>

695
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:54,935
<i>Start without me.</i>

696
00:49:09,074 --> 00:49:12,744
<i>March 10th. City services at a halt,
one week and counting.</i>

697
00:49:12,911 --> 00:49:15,122
<i>Public transportation, suspended.</i>

698
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:18,375
<i>Piles of garbage, uncollected.
Schools on strike.</i>

699
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:20,169
<i>No mail, no milk.</i>

700
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:21,336
It's me again.

701
00:49:21,461 --> 00:49:22,921
<i>What will normal reality be?</i>

702
00:49:23,005 --> 00:49:26,758
<i>Next week, next month, whenever, if ever,
we get the chance to experience it again.</i>

703
00:49:27,342 --> 00:49:28,343
<i>Anyone's guess.</i>

704
00:49:28,468 --> 00:49:29,678
What's this part?

705
00:49:29,845 --> 00:49:31,263
I added an appendix.

706
00:49:31,513 --> 00:49:32,723
-You're joking.
-No, I'm not.

707
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:34,641
You finished my manifesto without me.

708
00:49:34,808 --> 00:49:36,560
I made it sound like you, I think.

709
00:49:36,727 --> 00:49:38,145
Just more clear, more concise...

710
00:49:38,312 --> 00:49:39,646
a bit less poetic.

711
00:49:39,813 --> 00:49:43,442
Put it this way, this isn't
the first manifesto I've proofread.

712
00:49:47,779 --> 00:49:49,656
<i>Impossible to imagine these students,</i>

713
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:52,451
<i>exhilarated, naive,
brave in the extreme...</i>

714
00:49:53,869 --> 00:49:56,413
<i>returning to their obedient classrooms.</i>

715
00:50:05,047 --> 00:50:06,215
Who was that?

716
00:50:06,381 --> 00:50:07,841
-Your mother.
-My mother.

717
00:50:08,008 --> 00:50:09,635
My mother?

718
00:50:09,801 --> 00:50:11,303
What did she want?
Did you tell her I was here?

719
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:12,930
-Yes.
-Why?

720
00:50:13,263 --> 00:50:14,932
Because she asked. I don't lie.

721
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:16,600
Was she upset?

722
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:17,809
I don't think so.

723
00:50:17,935 --> 00:50:19,728
-What did she say?
-She nodded.

724
00:50:19,895 --> 00:50:20,979
What did you say?

725
00:50:21,146 --> 00:50:23,732
I told her I was working on an article
about you and your friends.

726
00:50:24,608 --> 00:50:25,609
So, you are.

727
00:50:25,943 --> 00:50:27,861
I've already written 1,000 words.

728
00:50:28,028 --> 00:50:29,404
I asked to interview her.

729
00:50:29,571 --> 00:50:30,572
Did she agree?

730
00:50:30,656 --> 00:50:31,907
Yes, of course.

731
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:35,285
Well, I am upset!

732
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:37,120
I don't know how to feel.

733
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:39,998
Am I in trouble?
Why would my mother be so calm?

734
00:50:40,165 --> 00:50:41,625
Is this proper?

735
00:50:42,042 --> 00:50:45,003
This is all off-the-record. Everything.
My whole life.

736
00:50:47,256 --> 00:50:48,841
What am I supposed to do now?

737
00:50:50,259 --> 00:50:52,678
I should maintain journalistic neutrality.

738
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,189
I like how ruthless you are.

739
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:06,817
It's part of your beauty, I think.

740
00:51:08,735 --> 00:51:11,113
So, you've got 1,000 words already?

741
00:51:13,699 --> 00:51:14,992
<i>The kids did this.</i>

742
00:51:15,158 --> 00:51:19,037
<i>Obliterated 1,000 years of Republican
authority in less than a fortnight.</i>

743
00:51:19,413 --> 00:51:21,123
<i>How and why?</i>

744
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:23,792
<i>Before it began,
where did it begin?</i>

745
00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:33,093
<i>It was another time. It was another Ennui.</i>

746
00:51:33,302 --> 00:51:36,889
<i>Must be nearly six months ago, I guess.
My sisters were still 12, anyway.</i>

747
00:51:43,228 --> 00:51:45,731
<i>You danced to the Craze
and the</i> Lait Chaud.

748
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:51,820
<i>You wore your hairdo in the Pompidou,
the Crouton, or the</i> Fruits-de-Mer.

749
00:51:53,155 --> 00:51:54,531
<i>Your slang mixed bits of Latin</i>

750
00:51:54,615 --> 00:51:57,284
<i>with philosophy jargon
and manual signaling.</i>

751
00:51:59,161 --> 00:52:01,747
<i>Devil's advocates bickered
and debated perpetually, ad nauseam,</i>

752
00:52:01,914 --> 00:52:03,498
<i>only for the sake of argument.</i>

753
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:08,170
<i>Every clique had a rival.</i>

754
00:52:11,465 --> 00:52:14,426
<i>The Nuts had the Bolts.
The Sticks had the Stones.</i>

755
00:52:14,593 --> 00:52:16,470
<i>The Jocks had us, the Bookworms,</i>

756
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:18,263
<i>until Mitch-Mitch failed
the baccalaureate...</i>

757
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:20,807
<i>and got sent down
to National Duty-obligation.</i>

758
00:52:21,016 --> 00:52:23,101
<i>Three months in the Mustard Region.</i>

759
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:01,390
He was sent to the Mustard Region
for National Duty-obligation.

760
00:53:04,768 --> 00:53:05,769
I'm sorry?

761
00:53:07,396 --> 00:53:10,190
How dare you? Who gave you permission
to besmirch our friend?

762
00:53:10,357 --> 00:53:11,358
Does it occur to you...

763
00:53:11,441 --> 00:53:13,694
he's very probably somewhere marching
in the middle of the night right now...

764
00:53:13,861 --> 00:53:16,446
carrying a 50-pound sack of gunpowder
and peeling stale potatoes...

765
00:53:16,613 --> 00:53:19,199
while he digs a latrine trench
in the rain with a tin cup?

766
00:53:19,366 --> 00:53:20,951
He doesn't want to be in the military.

767
00:53:28,584 --> 00:53:32,087
Easy for you to say
from the comfort of the <i>Sans Blague.</i>

768
00:53:39,845 --> 00:53:41,597
Mitch-Mitch, what are you doing here?

769
00:53:41,763 --> 00:53:44,057
You're supposed to be in the Mustard
Region for another two months.

770
00:53:44,349 --> 00:53:46,435
<i>Five years later, I, myself, translated...</i>

771
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:51,148
<i>Mitch-Mitch Simca's poetic interpretation
of his National Duty-obligation service.</i>

772
00:53:54,776 --> 00:53:57,779
<i>The flashback scene
in Act Two of</i> Goodbye, Zeffirelli.

773
00:53:57,946 --> 00:54:00,532
In North Africa,
I caught a bullet in the tail.

774
00:54:01,116 --> 00:54:03,368
In South America, I caught a chunk
of high-explosive shrapnel

775
00:54:03,452 --> 00:54:04,661
in the left wing.

776
00:54:05,204 --> 00:54:08,415
In East Asia, I picked up a rare,
microbial, infectious gut-parasite...

777
00:54:08,582 --> 00:54:12,252
in the lower abdominal cavity,
and I've got them all with me right now...

778
00:54:12,419 --> 00:54:13,754
still in my body...

779
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:17,716
but I don't regret my choice
to wear this uniform.

780
00:54:18,383 --> 00:54:21,178
And in 16 years, I'll get my pension.

781
00:54:22,513 --> 00:54:24,806
Well, that's your bedtime story, ladies.
Lights out!

782
00:54:24,973 --> 00:54:27,684
Hup! Ho! Hut! Lights out!
Covers tucked! Blankets on!

783
00:54:27,851 --> 00:54:29,144
-Pray your prayers!
-Sir!

784
00:54:34,316 --> 00:54:36,902
Amen. Amen. Amen.

785
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:46,495
Psst, Mitch-Mitch. Psst.

786
00:54:46,912 --> 00:54:49,498
Psst, Mitch-Mitch. What do you wanna be?

787
00:54:49,915 --> 00:54:50,916
What?

788
00:54:50,999 --> 00:54:52,709
What do you want to be, Mitch-Mitch?

789
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:56,129
With my grades,
I'll be an assistant pharmacist.

790
00:54:56,296 --> 00:54:57,923
Will that make you be satisfied?

791
00:54:58,507 --> 00:55:01,134
It won't depress me.
I should have studied harder.

792
00:55:01,301 --> 00:55:02,636
And you, Robouchon?

793
00:55:02,803 --> 00:55:05,973
I have no choice.
I'll work for my father's glass factory.

794
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:07,724
Someone has to take over.

795
00:55:07,891 --> 00:55:08,892
It's normal.

796
00:55:09,017 --> 00:55:10,686
Vaugirard. What's your plan?

797
00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:13,063
I suppose I'll continue
to be an attractive wastrel...

798
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:14,898
like my cousins on both sides
of the family.

799
00:55:15,065 --> 00:55:16,733
-Your cousins are the best.
-I love your cousins.

800
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,986
-Yeah.
-What about you, Morisot?

801
00:55:20,988 --> 00:55:22,781
Morisot, what do you want to be?

802
00:55:25,367 --> 00:55:26,577
A protestor.

803
00:55:27,911 --> 00:55:28,912
What'd he say?

804
00:55:28,996 --> 00:55:30,539
He said, "A protestor."

805
00:55:30,706 --> 00:55:31,707
What does he mean?

806
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:32,791
I don't know.

807
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:36,128
I thought Morisot was supposed to be
a professor of geological chemistry.

808
00:55:36,295 --> 00:55:37,421
Morisot's crying.

809
00:55:38,338 --> 00:55:39,423
Who said "shh"?

810
00:55:39,965 --> 00:55:41,091
I won't do it.

811
00:55:42,885 --> 00:55:45,846
It's only eight more weeks, Morisot,
before we complete the program.

812
00:55:46,221 --> 00:55:47,890
I don't mean the program.

813
00:55:49,892 --> 00:55:52,895
I mean from when we go home
until retirement age.

814
00:55:53,061 --> 00:55:57,399
That 48-year period of my life, I mean.
That's what I won't do.

815
00:55:58,442 --> 00:56:02,779
I can no longer envision myself
as a grown-up man in our parents' world.

816
00:56:11,622 --> 00:56:14,041
Morisot!
He went out the window!

817
00:56:15,834 --> 00:56:17,419
-Is he dead?
-I don't know.

818
00:56:17,586 --> 00:56:18,754
How far did he fall?

819
00:56:18,921 --> 00:56:19,922
Five floors with high ceilings.

820
00:56:20,088 --> 00:56:22,758
It rained last night.
Maybe the mud's still soft.

821
00:56:22,925 --> 00:56:24,051
He's not moving.

822
00:56:25,677 --> 00:56:27,054
He's still not moving.

823
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,015
He's still not moving.

824
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:32,643
He's still not moving.

825
00:56:33,727 --> 00:56:35,103
He's still not moving.

826
00:56:35,938 --> 00:56:37,147
He's still not moving.

827
00:56:38,106 --> 00:56:39,441
He's still not moving.

The appendix.

Polished it. Certain passages.

869
01:01:32,693 --> 01:01:34,236
I inscribed it to you.

873
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:53,255
You're a very bright girl, Juliette.

874
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:56,466
If you put away your powder puff
for one minute, forgive me...

875
01:01:56,633 --> 01:01:58,677
and think for yourself for one minute,
forgive me...

876
01:01:58,886 --> 01:02:01,013
you might realize
you're all in this together.

877

Even the riot police.

Our move.

879
01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:19,031
That was impolite. Of me.

880
01:02:19,406 --> 01:02:21,158
I withdraw the remark.

881
01:02:23,994 --> 01:02:25,162
I beg your pardon.

882
01:02:27,497 --> 01:02:28,498

You're sure?

885
01:02:39,468 --> 01:02:41,011
Sure you're not a child?

886
01:02:43,472 --> 01:02:46,475
Then learn to accept an apology.
That's important.

887

Grown-ups.

888

Our move. The mayor's waiting.

889
01:03:19,174 --> 01:03:21,510
Kindly leave me my dignity.

890
01:03:22,928 --> 01:03:25,389
She's not an old maid.
She's not in love with me.

891
01:03:25,556 --> 01:03:27,182
She's our friend. I'm her friend.

892
01:03:27,349 --> 01:03:29,184
She's confused.
She wants to help us.

893
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:32,229
She's angry.
She's a very good writer.

894
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:36,275
It's a lonely life, isn't it?

895
01:03:37,776 --> 01:03:39,069
Sometimes.

896
01:03:40,362 --> 01:03:43,365
It's true. I should maintain
journalistic neutrality...

897
01:03:43,574 --> 01:03:44,867

She's the best of them.

901
01:04:19,902 --> 01:04:22,529
Stop bickering. Go make love.

902
01:04:27,409 --> 01:04:29,703
Me, too. Except for Mrs. Krementz.

903

"The promotion of..."

I'll be right back.

937

Zeffirelli!

938
01:07:49,486 --> 01:07:52,656
<i>He is not an invincible comet
speeding on its guided arc...</i>

939
01:07:52,823 --> 01:07:56,076
<i>toward the outer reaches of the galaxy
in cosmic space-time.</i>

940
01:07:59,371 --> 01:08:01,915
<i>Rather, he is a boy who will die young.</i>

941
01:08:03,625 --> 01:08:05,627
<i>He will drown on this planet...</i>

942
01:08:06,211 --> 01:08:08,881
<i>in the steady current of the deep, dirty,
magnificent river...</i>

943
01:08:09,047 --> 01:08:13,218
<i>that flows night and day through the veins
and arteries of his own ancient city.</i>

944
01:08:15,429 --> 01:08:17,764
<i>His parents will receive a telephone call
at midnight...</i>

945

<i>dress briskly, mechanically,
and hold hands in the silent taxi...</i>

946

<i>as they go to identify the body
of their cold son.</i>

947
01:08:26,857 --> 01:08:29,902
<i>His likeness, mass-produced
and shrink-wrap packaged...</i>

948
01:08:30,068 --> 01:08:32,571
<i>will be sold like bubblegum
to the hero-inspired...</i>

949
01:08:32,738 --> 01:08:35,573
<i>who hope to see themselves like this.</i>

950
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,202
<i>The touching narcissism of the young.</i>

951

<i>March 30th.</i>

952
01:09:00,807 --> 01:09:03,143
<i>Across the street, a glaring metaphor.</i>

953
01:09:03,519 --> 01:09:07,773
<i>Bell rings, pupils scamper inside back
to their obedient classrooms.</i>

954
01:09:13,237 --> 01:09:16,448
<i>A creaky swing sways
in the deserted schoolyard.</i>

955
01:09:28,042 --> 01:09:29,044
Come in!

956
01:10:18,051 --> 01:10:21,722
Someone told me you have
a photographic memory.

957
01:10:21,889 --> 01:10:24,391
-Is that true?
-That is false.

958
01:10:24,558 --> 01:10:26,768
I have a typographic memory.

959
01:10:26,935 --> 01:10:30,355
I recollect the written word with
considerable accuracy and detail.

960
01:10:30,522 --> 01:10:35,068
In other spheres, my powers of retention
are distinctly impressionistic.

961
01:10:35,235 --> 01:10:38,322
I'm known to my intimates
as a most forgetful man.

962
01:10:38,488 --> 01:10:41,033
Yet you remember
every word you ever wrote.

963
01:10:41,491 --> 01:10:43,827
The novels, the essays, the poems,
the plays...

964
01:10:43,994 --> 01:10:46,830
The unrequited valentines. Sadly, I do.

965
01:10:47,664 --> 01:10:48,957
May I test you?

966
01:10:49,124 --> 01:10:50,292
If you must.

967
01:10:50,459 --> 01:10:52,961
Unless we try the patience
of your viewership...

968
01:10:53,504 --> 01:10:57,257
or the esteemed spokesmen
for Gemini tooth powder?

969
01:10:57,966 --> 01:11:00,219
My favorite piece
is the one about the cook...

970
01:11:00,385 --> 01:11:02,221

<i>Monsieur</i> Nescaffier made

known as <i>Gastronomie Gendarmique.</i>

"Police cooking" began with the stake-out
picnic and paddy-wagon snack...

994
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:26,138
but has evolved and codified
into something refined...

995
01:12:26,305 --> 01:12:29,308
intensely nourishing, and,
if executed properly...

996
01:12:29,516 --> 01:12:31,226
marvelously flavorful.

997

the other being reserved
for firearms and paperwork.

1001
01:12:48,368 --> 01:12:51,246
Most dishes are served pre-cut.
Nothing crunchy.

1002
01:12:51,663 --> 01:12:52,748
Quiet food.

1003
01:12:55,709 --> 01:12:58,670
Sauces are dehydrated and ground
to a powder to avoid spillage...

1004
01:12:58,837 --> 01:13:00,881
and the risk of
the tainting of a crime scene.

1005
01:13:02,799 --> 01:13:05,761
Diners are expected to provide their own
<i>fourchettes de poche</i>...

often engraved with the arcane mottoes...

01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:10,390
and off-color sayings of their
respective precincts.

1008
01:13:37,209 --> 01:13:39,753
How are you planning to kill me?

1009
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:44,633
I believe this to be...

1010
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,094
a case of mistaken identity.

1011
01:13:50,973 --> 01:13:54,518
Have you been in the chicken coop
for a very long while?

1012
01:14:01,692 --> 01:14:03,443
I beg your pardon.

Chef Cuisinier <i>for the private dining
room of the...</i>

01:14:28,594 --> 01:14:31,013
Commissaire de la Police Municipale.

1019
01:14:40,147 --> 01:14:42,065
Forgive my tardiness.

1020
01:14:44,067 --> 01:14:45,903
No, not at all. Not at all.

1021
01:14:48,906 --> 01:14:50,699
Mr. Wright, may I present my mother...

1022
01:14:50,866 --> 01:14:53,243
Louise de la Villatte.
You can call her Maman.

1023
01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:54,536
We all do.

1024
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,372
This is my oldest friend, Chou-fleur.

1025
01:14:57,539 --> 01:15:00,542
When I met him,
he was a girlish little schoolboy...

1026
01:15:00,709 --> 01:15:03,170
with ringlets and a full set of teeth.

1027
01:15:03,504 --> 01:15:05,881
Now, he looks like a corpse.

1028
01:15:06,632 --> 01:15:08,800
In the corner, Patrolman Maupassant.

1029
01:15:08,967 --> 01:15:10,469
He'll be serving.

1030
01:15:11,094 --> 01:15:12,262
Cocktails.

1031
01:15:16,642 --> 01:15:19,728
And this is my son, Gigi,
in the crime-lab smock.

1032
01:15:19,895 --> 01:15:22,814
What are you stealing
from my personal records?

1033
01:15:23,315 --> 01:15:24,858
Unsolved cases.

1034
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,194
Well, say hello to Mr. Wright.

1035
01:15:27,402 --> 01:15:28,403
Hello, Mr. Wright.

1036
01:15:28,654 --> 01:15:30,030
Hello, Gigi.

1037
01:15:31,156 --> 01:15:34,409
<i>Full name, Isadore Sharif de la Villatte.</i>

1038
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:38,539
<i>The Commissaire and his only son...</i>

1039
01:15:38,705 --> 01:15:41,708
<i>widowered and motherless,
left the colony where the boy was born,</i>

1040
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:44,044
<i>cemented together by their shared grief.</i>

1041
01:15:44,211 --> 01:15:45,838
<i>Gigi was six.</i>

1042
01:15:46,797 --> 01:15:49,800
<i>His schoolrooms were the station house
and the squad car.</i>

1043
01:15:51,134 --> 01:15:54,847
<i>He was educated by forensic tutors
in the traditions of law enforcement.</i>

1044
01:15:56,390 --> 01:16:00,018
<i>His first drawings were facial composites
based on eyewitness testimony.</i>

1045
01:16:02,938 --> 01:16:05,816
<i>His first words were in Morse code.</i>

1046
01:16:06,066 --> 01:16:09,152
<i>It was, I suppose, wonderfully obvious.</i>

1047
01:16:09,236 --> 01:16:12,281
<i>He was brought up to succeed
the Commissaire himself.</i>

1048
01:16:14,199 --> 01:16:16,410
Yes, I've read you. In the magazine.

1049
01:16:17,828 --> 01:16:19,621
To your satisfaction?

1050
01:16:20,038 --> 01:16:21,874
Of course. Of course.

1051
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:23,292
Good writer.

1052
01:16:25,878 --> 01:16:28,797
I trust you are already familiar
with this genius.

1053
01:16:28,964 --> 01:16:30,591
At least by reputation.

1054
01:16:30,757 --> 01:16:32,217
Lieutenant Nescaffier.

1055
01:16:32,384 --> 01:16:33,594
I surely am.

1056

<i>The drink, a milky, purplish aperitif...</i>

1057

<i>ferociously fragrant, overtly medicinal,
ever so faintly anesthetizing...</i>

1058
01:16:54,448 --> 01:16:57,409
<i>and cooled to a glacial viscosity
in a miniature version...</i>

<i>which, during the subsequent
60-second interval...</i>

1063
01:17:06,001 --> 01:17:07,920
<i>was to be mortally broken.</i>

1064

<i>One.</i>

Monsieur<i> Nescaffier began
his mysterious ritual.</i>

<i>I can neither comprehend nor describe
what occurs behind a kitchen door.</i>

1069

<i>I have always been content
to enjoy the issue...</i>

1070

<i>of an artist's talent without unveiling
the secrets of the chisel...</i>

<i>or the turpentine.</i>

1072

<i>Two.</i>

<i>delivered a telephone to his superior.</i>

1076

Go ahead.

1077
01:17:59,221 --> 01:18:01,265
<i>As you know by now,
we have kidnapped your son...</i>

1078

<i>and absconded to a secure location
which you will never discover.</i>

1079
01:18:04,351 --> 01:18:06,395
<i>Release or execute the Abacus...</i>

1080

<i>and the little boy will be safely
returned to your custody.</i>

1081
01:18:09,106 --> 01:18:12,860
<i>Failure to do so by sun-up will result
in your son's violent death.</i>

1082
01:18:19,950 --> 01:18:21,243
<i>Three.</i>

1083
01:18:21,535 --> 01:18:23,161
<i>The skylight window

1084
01:18:23,328 --> 01:18:26,456
<i>which occupies the attic quarters
jimmied ajar.</i>

1085

<i>The getaway and eventual motor pursuit

<i>if, perhaps, a bit fancifully,
in a comic strip...</i>

1087
01:19:05,996 --> 01:19:07,664
<i>published the following week.</i>

1088
01:19:42,491 --> 01:19:44,493
<i>Though the infamous Ennui gang war...</i>

1089
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:48,247
<i>"Winter Crimewave" had eradicated
a healthy number of thugs and hooligans...</i>

1090
01:19:48,413 --> 01:19:50,082
<i>it had also claimed the lives...</i>

1091
01:19:50,249 --> 01:19:53,001
<i>of a disgraceful proportion
of innocent citizens.</i>

1092
01:19:54,962 --> 01:19:57,422
<i>Due to the surprise capture
of the racketeering accountant...</i>

1093
01:19:57,589 --> 01:20:01,093
<i>Albert "the Abacus", in possession
of a valise containing payroll stubs...</i>

1094
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:03,804
<i>for all three of the city's
major syndicates...</i>

1095
01:20:03,971 --> 01:20:06,723
<i>the law-abiding community's hopes
for an accelerated resolution...</i>

1096
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:09,017
<i>to the crisis had been renewed.</i>

1097
01:20:14,147 --> 01:20:17,192
<i>However, this turn of events had
forcefully rattled the cages...</i>

1098
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:19,695
<i>of the denizens
of the criminal underworld.</i>

1099
01:20:25,909 --> 01:20:28,912
For myself, I had failed to recognize
the Abacus...

1100
01:20:29,162 --> 01:20:31,832
but as it happened,
I knew the chicken coop.

1101
01:20:31,999 --> 01:20:33,667
This is not in the article, by the way.

1102
01:20:33,834 --> 01:20:36,003
If I refer to Mr. Howitzer,
do you know who I mean?

1103
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:37,754
Of course. Arthur Howitzer, Jr.

1104
01:20:37,921 --> 01:20:39,840
Founder and editor of <i>The French Dispatch.</i>

1105
01:20:40,048 --> 01:20:43,343
It was my first week in Ennui
when I suffered the misfortune...

1106
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:46,138
of being arrested
in a drinking establishment...

1107
01:20:46,305 --> 01:20:48,307
on the fringes of the Flop Quarter...

1108
01:20:48,515 --> 01:20:51,894
along with a number of
newly-found companions.

1109
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:53,645
What was the charge?

1110
01:20:54,062 --> 01:20:55,480
Love.

1111
01:20:56,315 --> 01:20:58,650
You see, people may or may not
be mildly threatened...

1112
01:20:58,859 --> 01:21:01,320
by your anger, your hatred,
your pride...

1113
01:21:01,486 --> 01:21:03,780
but love the wrong way...

1114
01:21:03,947 --> 01:21:06,158
and you will find yourself
in great jeopardy.

1115
01:21:06,867 --> 01:21:10,037
In this case, a chicken coop jail cell
for six days straight.

1116
01:21:10,495 --> 01:21:13,665
I had no one who cared to rescue me,
and no one who cared to scold me.

1117
01:21:14,166 --> 01:21:18,003
And the only local number
committed to my typographic memory was...

1118
01:21:18,629 --> 01:21:20,714
<i>Printer's District 9-2211.</i>

1119
01:21:20,881 --> 01:21:24,551
<i>While I regret we are unable to publish
either of these specific pieces...</i>

1120
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:27,804
<i>I would be very pleased to consider
other submissions in the future.</i>

1121
01:21:27,971 --> 01:21:30,098
<i>Or if you find yourself in Ennui...</i>

1122
01:21:35,938 --> 01:21:37,356
<i>I'd never met the man.</i>

1123
01:21:37,981 --> 01:21:41,235
<i>I knew how to reach him
only because I wanted a job.</i>

1124
01:21:59,878 --> 01:22:01,380
Let's see here.

1125
01:22:02,548 --> 01:22:05,509
High school newspaper,
poetry club, drama society.

1126
01:22:05,717 --> 01:22:08,554
Wrote the school song.
Words and music.

1127
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:11,932
Junior researcher,
cub reporter, assistant editor.

1128
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:13,225
Fires and murders.

1129
01:22:13,392 --> 01:22:14,601
That's how I started.

1130
01:22:14,768 --> 01:22:16,645
My father owned the paper, of course.

1131
01:22:16,979 --> 01:22:19,565
Bit of sports, bit of crime,
bit of politics.

1132
01:22:19,731 --> 01:22:21,942
Shortlisted twice, Best Essays.

1133
01:22:22,109 --> 01:22:24,570
Deep South, Midwest, East Coast.

1134
01:22:24,736 --> 01:22:26,029
Vast country.

1135
01:22:26,822 --> 01:22:28,615
Haven't been there in 20 years.

1136
01:22:29,324 --> 01:22:32,828
Not now.
I'm conducting a job interview.

1137
01:22:33,287 --> 01:22:36,164
Your writing samples are good.
I re-read them in the taxi.

1138
01:22:36,331 --> 01:22:37,833
Have you ever done any book reviews?

1139
01:22:39,126 --> 01:22:40,210
Never.

1140
01:22:40,377 --> 01:22:43,338
You're gonna be in there another few hours
before they process you out.

1141
01:22:45,507 --> 01:22:47,342
Read this. Give me 300 words.

1142
01:22:48,635 --> 01:22:52,222
I'll pay you 500 francs
minus the 250 I advanced for your bail...

1143
01:22:52,431 --> 01:22:55,559
but I'll re-advance that
against cost of living.

1144
01:22:55,767 --> 01:22:58,228
Bring me a first draft tomorrow morning...

1145
01:22:58,395 --> 01:23:00,689
and however you go about it, Mr. Wright...

1146
01:23:00,856 --> 01:23:03,859
try to make it sound like you
wrote it that way on purpose.

1147
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:13,410
Thank you.

1148
01:23:15,954 --> 01:23:17,414
No crying.

1149
01:23:25,506 --> 01:23:27,841
It came to be known
as the "Night of a Thousand Slugs."

1150
01:23:28,008 --> 01:23:29,218
I'm reciting again.

1151
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:32,721
<i>How the Commissaire and his elite team of
experts and analysts...</i>

1152
01:23:32,888 --> 01:23:36,475
<i>succeeded so swiftly in determining
the location of the kidnappers' lair...</i>

1153
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:41,480
<i>Well...</i>

1154
01:23:45,817 --> 01:23:47,486
<i>I just don't know.</i>

1155
01:23:50,864 --> 01:23:53,075
<i>The tools of the trade, I suppose.</i>

1156
01:23:59,873 --> 01:24:01,959
<i>But succeed they did.</i>

1157
01:24:36,451 --> 01:24:37,786
<i>Who were they?</i>

1158
01:24:39,621 --> 01:24:41,039
<i>It was later revealed.</i>

1159
01:24:42,165 --> 01:24:45,419
<i>A hired crew of bandits and gunmen
imported by the ranking bosses...</i>

1160
01:24:45,586 --> 01:24:49,173
<i>of the Ennui rackets
and their network of underworld middlemen.</i>

1161
01:24:50,966 --> 01:24:54,761
<i>Chauffeur Joe Lefèvre,
a once almost promising instrumentalist.</i>

1162
01:24:55,929 --> 01:24:58,473
<i>Stetson, Spinster,
and Hieronymus Von Altman,</i>

1163
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:00,142
<i>Dutch masterminds.</i>

1164
01:25:00,726 --> 01:25:04,188
<i>Marconi Brutelli,
the Mediterranean anarchist.</i>

1165
01:25:05,355 --> 01:25:08,108
<i>A pair of hooligans, estranged cousins.</i>

1166
01:25:09,443 --> 01:25:12,613
<i>A trio of showgirls, all junkies.</i>

1167
01:25:14,656 --> 01:25:16,658
<i>Plus one small, resourceful prisoner...</i>

1168
01:25:16,825 --> 01:25:20,204
<i>determined to free himself and
reduce taxpayer expense.</i>

1169
01:25:31,089 --> 01:25:32,591
What's that noise?

1170
01:25:34,092 --> 01:25:37,012
Air bubbles in the radiator pipes.
It's pressurized.

1171
01:25:37,179 --> 01:25:38,805
Sounds like Morse code.

1172
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:42,017
Vaguely, maybe.

1173
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:46,313
I'm Gigi, by the way.
What's your name?

1174
01:25:46,522 --> 01:25:49,107
I'm not gonna tell you that.
This is a felony.

1175
01:25:50,234 --> 01:25:53,445
You're not a criminal.
You're just a mixed-up showgirl.

1176
01:25:53,779 --> 01:25:56,114
-Ha.
-Ha, yourself.

1177
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:57,991
Shut up.

1178
01:25:58,867 --> 01:26:00,160
What color eyes do you have?

1179
01:26:00,410 --> 01:26:01,662
Blue?

1180
01:26:11,129 --> 01:26:12,256
Hello.

1181
01:26:13,924 --> 01:26:15,133
Hello.

1182
01:26:19,429 --> 01:26:21,181
Sing me a lullaby.

1183
01:26:21,348 --> 01:26:22,766
I'm scared.

1184
01:26:52,045 --> 01:26:53,964
Are you asleep?

1185
01:27:00,012 --> 01:27:03,265
<i>The Commissaire adored Gigi
with all his voluminous heart.</i>

1186
01:27:03,432 --> 01:27:06,768
<i>However, his mind, that exceptional
machine for the detection...</i>

1187
01:27:06,935 --> 01:27:08,979
<i>and investigation of criminal activity,</i>

1188
01:27:10,606 --> 01:27:12,274
<i>had been whirring since dinnertime.</i>

1189
01:27:15,986 --> 01:27:18,989
<i>And he was in a condition
of dire calorific depletion.</i>

1190
01:27:21,575 --> 01:27:25,412
<i>Nescaffier, back in the field
for the first time in six years...</i>

1191
01:27:25,579 --> 01:27:27,706
<i>came prepared to dazzle.</i>

1192
01:27:32,002 --> 01:27:34,755
<i>The change was instantaneous.</i>

1193
01:27:42,471 --> 01:27:43,680
Nescaffier.

1194
01:27:43,847 --> 01:27:47,184
<i>Even as the faintest hints of the aromas
of the great chef's kitchen...</i>

1195
01:27:47,351 --> 01:27:49,394
<i>ribboned into
the Commissaire's nostrils...</i>

1196
01:27:49,561 --> 01:27:53,649
<i>he began to envision and
formulate a multi-pronged battle-plan.</i>

1197
01:27:53,815 --> 01:27:54,900
<i>To start...</i>

1198
01:27:55,067 --> 01:27:56,777
<i>Deviled eggs of the precinct canary...</i>

1199
01:27:56,944 --> 01:27:59,029
<i>served in shells of its own meringue.</i>

1200
01:28:01,198 --> 01:28:02,199
<i>Next...</i>

1201
01:28:03,617 --> 01:28:04,868
<i>Kidneys.</i>

1202
01:28:05,035 --> 01:28:07,663
<i>Poached with plums
from the mayor's rooftop arbor.</i>

1203
01:28:10,499 --> 01:28:11,500
<i>Then...</i>

1204
01:28:12,709 --> 01:28:15,128
<i>minced lamb bon-bons in pastry wrappers.</i>

1205
01:28:17,422 --> 01:28:18,465
<i>Blasé oyster soup.</i>

1206
01:28:20,676 --> 01:28:22,010
<i>A magnificent city-park pigeon hash.</i>

1207
01:28:22,177 --> 01:28:23,178
<i>Finally...</i>

1208
01:28:24,513 --> 01:28:26,557
<i>...tabac pudding with quadruple cream.</i>

1209
01:28:29,977 --> 01:28:31,228
May I interrupt with a question?

1210
01:28:31,311 --> 01:28:32,938
-Please.
-Forgive me.

1211
01:28:33,021 --> 01:28:34,481
Just permit me to dog-ear
the page. Mentally.

1212
01:28:34,648 --> 01:28:35,649
I beg your pardon.

1213
01:28:36,108 --> 01:28:39,111
You've written about the American negro,
the French intellectual...

1214
01:28:39,278 --> 01:28:41,113
-the Southern romantic...
-And the anti-negro.

1215
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,281
The anti-negro.

1216
01:28:43,156 --> 01:28:47,619
Scripture, mythology, folklore,
true crime, false crime...

1217
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:50,455
the ghost story, the picaresque,
the bildungsroman.

1218
01:28:50,622 --> 01:28:52,583
But more than anything,
over all these years...

1219
01:28:52,749 --> 01:28:54,376
you've written about food.

1220
01:28:54,751 --> 01:28:56,086
Why?

1221
01:28:57,296 --> 01:29:00,048
Who? What? Where? When? How?
Valid questions...

1222
01:29:00,215 --> 01:29:04,678
but I learned as a cub stringer,
never, under any circumstance...

1223
01:29:04,845 --> 01:29:08,140
if it is remotely within your power
to resist the impulse...

1224
01:29:08,348 --> 01:29:10,225
never ask a man why.

1225
01:29:11,018 --> 01:29:12,394
It tightens a fellow up.

1226
01:29:13,103 --> 01:29:14,104
I apologize,

1227
01:29:14,229 --> 01:29:15,397
-but I'm gonna hold you to it...
-Torture.

1228
01:29:15,731 --> 01:29:16,732
...if you'll agree.

1229
01:29:16,815 --> 01:29:20,527
Self-reflection is a vice
best conducted in private or not at all.

1230
01:29:21,695 --> 01:29:23,113
Well...

1231
01:29:23,864 --> 01:29:26,658
I'll answer your question out of
sheer weariness...

1232
01:29:28,577 --> 01:29:31,205
but I truly don't know
what I'm about to say.

1233
01:29:34,708 --> 01:29:38,086
There is a particular sad beauty...

1234
01:29:38,921 --> 01:29:42,925
well-known to the companionless foreigner
as he walks the streets of his adopted...

1235
01:29:43,091 --> 01:29:46,720
preferably moonlit, city.
In my case, Ennui, France.

1236
01:29:47,721 --> 01:29:49,223
I have so often...

1237
01:29:50,224 --> 01:29:53,769
I have so often shared
the day's glittering discoveries with...

1238
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,648
no one at all.

1239
01:29:58,565 --> 01:30:01,610
But always, somewhere along
the avenue or the boulevard...

1240
01:30:01,777 --> 01:30:04,446
there was a table set for me.

1241
01:30:05,656 --> 01:30:09,701
A cook, a waiter, a bottle,
a glass, a fire.

1242
01:30:11,828 --> 01:30:13,956
I chose this life.

1243
01:30:15,916 --> 01:30:19,628
It is the solitary feast that has been
very much like a comrade...

1244
01:30:19,795 --> 01:30:22,548
my great comfort and fortification.

1245
01:30:24,466 --> 01:30:27,094
<i>Do you remember
where you placed the bookmark?</i>

1246
01:30:27,928 --> 01:30:30,055
Of course, silly goose. "Meanwhile."

1247
01:30:30,556 --> 01:30:32,933
"Meanwhile, across the street..."

1248
01:31:25,819 --> 01:31:29,198
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

1249
01:31:37,873 --> 01:31:40,584
<i>During a lull in the skirmish,
an ancient concierge...</i>

1250
01:31:40,751 --> 01:31:42,961
<i>veteran of two wars,
limped across the street...</i>

1251
01:31:43,128 --> 01:31:45,088
<i>to deliver an enigmatic message.</i>

1252
01:31:57,935 --> 01:32:01,897
I'm speaking to the leader of the gang
of kidnappers on the top floor.

1253
01:32:02,272 --> 01:32:04,775
Do you have a working kitchen
in your lair?

1254
01:32:04,942 --> 01:32:06,610
My son needs a snack.

1255
01:32:06,777 --> 01:32:09,196
Allow us to send in our precinct cook...

1256
01:32:09,404 --> 01:32:11,615
along with some supplies and provisions.

1257
01:32:11,782 --> 01:32:14,284
He will prepare a supper
of sufficient proportions...

1258
01:32:14,451 --> 01:32:17,037
to feed you and all your accomplices.

1259
01:32:17,955 --> 01:32:19,540
We already ate.

1260
01:32:26,129 --> 01:32:27,714
Is it an underling...

1261
01:32:28,215 --> 01:32:30,259
or Nescaffier himself?

1262
01:32:58,245 --> 01:32:59,997
Blackbird pie.

1263
01:33:12,384 --> 01:33:14,720
<i>Required, of course,
to sample each item...</i>

1264
01:33:15,179 --> 01:33:18,056
<i>the chef ate the deathly poison.</i>

1265
01:33:23,645 --> 01:33:25,397
For the little boy.

1266
01:33:27,232 --> 01:33:28,442
Stop.

1267
01:33:30,360 --> 01:33:31,987
Write down the recipe.

1268
01:33:43,707 --> 01:33:44,833
Help...

1269
01:33:48,003 --> 01:33:49,588
<i>But Nescaffier survived...</i>

1270
01:33:49,755 --> 01:33:51,715
<i>thanks to the extreme fortitude...</i>

1271
01:33:51,882 --> 01:33:56,011
<i>bolstered and braced, season upon season,
by the richest, most potent plates...</i>

1272
01:33:56,178 --> 01:33:57,804
<i>pans, and sauce pots...</i>

1273
01:33:57,971 --> 01:34:01,016
<i>of his almost superhuman stomach.</i>

1274
01:34:02,184 --> 01:34:03,602
<i>He knew well, of course...</i>

1275
01:34:03,769 --> 01:34:06,813
<i>Gigi loathed and despised
the radish in all its forms...</i>

1276
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:08,899
<i>with a deep, unbridled passion,</i>

1277
01:34:09,066 --> 01:34:10,776
<i>and had never so much as touched one...</i>

1278
01:34:10,943 --> 01:34:14,488
<i>or even spoken the word,
during his entire young lifetime.</i>

1279
01:34:14,947 --> 01:34:16,823
<i>However, as it happened...</i>

1280
01:34:18,116 --> 01:34:20,536
<i>the chauffeur hated radishes, too.</i>

1281
01:36:25,244 --> 01:36:26,620
Take the wheel!

1282
01:36:50,602 --> 01:36:53,146
<i>Perhaps the most stirring and startling
phenomenon witnessed...</i>

1283
01:36:53,313 --> 01:36:56,608
<i>over the trajectory of that
protracted dinner date was this...</i>

1284
01:37:09,246 --> 01:37:12,708
<i>A delicious irony.</i> Monsieur <i>Albert...</i>

1285
01:37:12,875 --> 01:37:14,084
<i>accountant to the</i> demi-monde

1286
01:37:14,168 --> 01:37:16,712
<i>and remote cause
of the entire spectacular contretemps...</i>

1287
01:37:16,879 --> 01:37:18,338
<i>had been forgotten in the chicken coop</i>

1288
01:37:18,422 --> 01:37:20,174
<i>from Thursday dinner
to Monday breakfast...</i>

1289
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:22,676
<i>and had very nearly starved in his cell.</i>

1290
01:37:23,051 --> 01:37:25,345
It was only the convalescent
<i>Monsieur</i> Nescaffier himself...

1291
01:37:25,512 --> 01:37:27,806
who retained the presence
of mind to prepare the prisoner...

1292
01:37:27,973 --> 01:37:30,517
an <i>omelette à la policier,
</i>which he delivered warm...

1293
01:37:30,684 --> 01:37:32,936
wrapped in a day-old search warrant.

1294
01:37:34,771 --> 01:37:36,899
The Abacus ate well that morning.

1295
01:37:39,902 --> 01:37:42,070
A word from Gemini tooth powder.

1296
01:37:45,032 --> 01:37:47,034
It was supposed to be
an article about a great chef.

1297
01:37:47,117 --> 01:37:48,118
It is in part.

1298
01:37:48,285 --> 01:37:49,703
For the Tastes and Smells section...

1299
01:37:49,870 --> 01:37:52,539
I understand.
The assignment was perfectly clear.

1300
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:56,168
Perhaps, you fail to grasp...

1301
01:37:56,335 --> 01:37:59,755
that I was shot at
and hand-grenaded against my will.

1302
01:38:00,422 --> 01:38:02,424
I only asked to be fed,
and was, marvelously,

1303
01:38:02,508 --> 01:38:04,343
as I described in some detail.

1304
01:38:05,093 --> 01:38:07,763
Nescaffier only gets one line of dialogue.

1305
01:38:10,224 --> 01:38:14,102
Well, I did cut something he told me.
It made me too sad.

1306
01:38:15,062 --> 01:38:16,772
I could stick it back in, if you like.

1307
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:19,942
What did he say?

1308
01:38:41,171 --> 01:38:42,464
Martin... Martin...

1309
01:38:42,631 --> 01:38:43,882
Guillaume Martin.

1310
01:38:54,017 --> 01:38:55,727
They had a flavor.

1311
01:38:57,688 --> 01:38:59,189
I beg your pardon?

1312
01:39:00,607 --> 01:39:04,736
The toxic salts in the radishes...

1313
01:39:04,903 --> 01:39:06,488
they had a flavor.

1314
01:39:07,573 --> 01:39:10,200
Totally unfamiliar to me.

1315
01:39:10,951 --> 01:39:15,163
Like a bitter, moldy, peppery...

1316
01:39:16,039 --> 01:39:18,917
spicy, oily kind of...

1317
01:39:20,085 --> 01:39:21,420
earth.

1318
01:39:22,296 --> 01:39:25,090
I never tasted that taste in my life.

1319
01:39:26,008 --> 01:39:27,926
Not entirely pleasant...

1320
01:39:28,552 --> 01:39:30,512
extremely poisonous...

1321
01:39:31,013 --> 01:39:33,515
but still, a new flavor.

1322
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:36,894
That's a rare thing at my age.

1323
01:39:39,062 --> 01:39:41,565
I admire your bravery, Lieutenant.

1324
01:39:42,191 --> 01:39:44,109
I'm not brave.

1325
01:39:44,776 --> 01:39:46,361
I just wasn't...

1326
01:39:46,570 --> 01:39:48,155
in the mood to be...

1327
01:39:48,530 --> 01:39:50,574
a disappointment to everybody.

1328
01:39:52,409 --> 01:39:54,036
I'm a foreigner, you know.

1329
01:39:55,454 --> 01:39:57,706
This city is full of us, isn't it?

1330
01:39:58,707 --> 01:40:00,542
I'm one myself.

1331
01:40:02,669 --> 01:40:04,755
Seeking something missing.

1332
01:40:06,673 --> 01:40:09,009
Missing something left behind.

1333
01:40:12,221 --> 01:40:14,264
Maybe with good luck...

1334
01:40:14,431 --> 01:40:16,683
we'll find what eluded us...

1335
01:40:17,434 --> 01:40:19,937
in the places we once called home.

1336
01:40:28,904 --> 01:40:31,281
That's the best part of the whole thing.

1337
01:40:32,157 --> 01:40:34,493
That's the reason for it to be written.

1338
01:40:36,703 --> 01:40:38,580
I couldn't agree less.

1339
01:40:40,624 --> 01:40:43,836
Well, anyway, don't cut it.

1340
01:41:13,615 --> 01:41:14,908
Are we all here?

1341
01:41:15,701 --> 01:41:18,120
I guess you know.
It was a heart attack.

1342
01:41:33,635 --> 01:41:34,845
No crying.

1343
01:41:41,935 --> 01:41:44,104
Is somebody coming to take him away?

1344
01:41:44,271 --> 01:41:46,315
There's a strike at the morgue.

1345
01:41:49,943 --> 01:41:51,028
Who was with him?

1346
01:41:51,195 --> 01:41:52,529
He was alone.

1347
01:41:52,696 --> 01:41:54,364
Reading birthday telegrams.

1348
01:41:57,034 --> 01:41:59,828
Don't light the candles.
He's dead.

1349
01:42:00,913 --> 01:42:02,497
I'll have a slice.

1350
01:42:03,081 --> 01:42:04,333
Me, too.

1351
01:42:05,375 --> 01:42:07,920
We need to draft something. Who wants it?

1352
01:42:08,086 --> 01:42:09,087
We've got a file.

1353
01:42:09,213 --> 01:42:10,547
I'm working on the art.

1354
01:42:13,467 --> 01:42:15,093
That's him.

1355
01:42:19,223 --> 01:42:20,974
Let's write it together.

1356
01:42:21,141 --> 01:42:22,142
Write what?

1357
01:42:22,226 --> 01:42:23,894
The obituary.

1358
01:42:25,479 --> 01:42:28,273
Arthur Howitzer, Jr.
Born in North Kansas...

1359
01:42:28,440 --> 01:42:31,652
10 miles from the geographical center
of the United States.

1360
01:42:31,818 --> 01:42:33,070
Mother died when he was five.

1361
01:42:33,237 --> 01:42:35,739
Son of a newspaper publisher,
founder of this magazine.

1362
01:42:35,906 --> 01:42:38,075
<i>The French Dispatch,
</i>previously known as <i>Picnic.</i>

1363
01:42:38,242 --> 01:42:42,120
A largely unread Sunday supplement
to the <i>Liberty, Kansas Evening Sun.</i>

1364
01:42:42,287 --> 01:42:43,747
It began as a holiday.

1365
01:42:43,914 --> 01:42:44,957
Is that true?

1366
01:42:45,123 --> 01:42:46,208
Sort of.

1367
01:42:48,627 --> 01:42:50,254
What happens next?
