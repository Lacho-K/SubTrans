1
00:00:23,904 --> 00:00:25,029
Can I trust you?

2
00:00:27,154 --> 00:00:30,446
Of course you can
trust me, my dear Kjetil.

3
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:34,404
Because if I can, I might...
I might get out of this place

4
00:00:34,488 --> 00:00:36,363
where I'm so angry,

5
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:39,863
suspicious, and desperate.

6
00:00:40,363 --> 00:00:42,988
I just wish we'd talked
about all this before.

7
00:00:43,071 --> 00:00:47,071
I've been so suspicious that I...
that I went through your phone.

8
00:00:51,071 --> 00:00:52,321
You're right, though.

9
00:00:52,904 --> 00:00:53,904
It's not my fault.

10
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:57,738
I saw all those text
messages you sent to Daniel.

11
00:00:57,821 --> 00:00:59,988
I saw everything you
said to each other.

12
00:01:00,071 --> 00:01:02,613
- Kjetil...
- I saw the things that you two have done.

13
00:01:02,696 --> 00:01:05,029
- How could you go through my phone?
- No, it's good.

14
00:01:05,571 --> 00:01:08,279
Because now I
know. I know all of it.

15
00:01:08,363 --> 00:01:11,904
Now I'm fully aware that you're
just a lying, cheating whore.

16
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:14,529
- That's what you are.
- All of it?

17
00:01:16,029 --> 00:01:17,238
You don't know all of it.

18
00:01:17,321 --> 00:01:19,779
Okay, no? Then what else?

19
00:01:19,863 --> 00:01:21,154
I'm pregnant.

20
00:01:23,488 --> 00:01:25,779
- What?
- I'm pregnant.

21
00:01:26,363 --> 00:01:27,654
We're having a kid?

22
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:29,113
Not us.

23
00:01:29,196 --> 00:01:30,863
Daniel and I

24
00:01:31,404 --> 00:01:32,613
are pregnant.

25
00:01:33,779 --> 00:01:35,029
Yeah. That's right.

26
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:40,113
I'm pregnant, and the father
is your dead brother's son.

27
00:01:53,654 --> 00:01:55,404
And... cut!

28
00:01:57,654 --> 00:01:59,696
Ah! I think that was a good one.

29
00:01:59,779 --> 00:02:03,404
Yeah, thanks, that's done.
Beautiful work, guys. Thanks.

30
00:02:03,946 --> 00:02:05,029
- Lars?
- Yeah?

31
00:02:05,988 --> 00:02:08,029
Do we need to, you
know, go again, or...

32
00:02:08,113 --> 00:02:10,821
No, it's good. Thanks,
yeah. It's great. Thanks. Gold.

33
00:02:13,404 --> 00:02:14,404
Gold.

34
00:02:24,321 --> 00:02:25,321
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

35
00:02:27,863 --> 00:02:29,738
That scene earlier was great.

36
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:30,904
- Think so?
- Mm-hm.

37
00:02:30,988 --> 00:02:33,571
- Oh, I'm so glad to hear that.
- Yeah. It was great.

38
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,350
Hey, I had a thought
for the next scene...

39
00:02:35,374 --> 00:02:37,154
We're going to the
cabin this weekend.

40
00:02:38,488 --> 00:02:40,154
I mean, me and Lisa are going.

41
00:02:40,238 --> 00:02:42,071
- How are things with Lisa?
- Oh, good.

42
00:02:42,654 --> 00:02:46,779
It's, uh... Lisa's Lisa. But
I'm good, and she's good.

43
00:02:46,863 --> 00:02:48,613
- That's what matters.
- That's really good.

44
00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:50,279
Yeah. Last time it wasn't, so...

45
00:02:50,363 --> 00:02:52,904
Yeah, it's been up and
down, but we're good now.

46
00:02:54,113 --> 00:02:55,738
- Tell her I said hi.
- Mm.

47
00:02:56,238 --> 00:03:00,154
But I hope that we can talk a little
about the scene we're about to do...

48
00:03:00,238 --> 00:03:03,613
Lisa said, this weekend,
she's going, um... hiking.

49
00:03:03,696 --> 00:03:06,196
She's gonna head up to the mountains.

50
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:07,363
All alone.

51
00:03:07,446 --> 00:03:09,571
So I said to her, "It's
dangerous, yeah?"

52
00:03:09,654 --> 00:03:10,904
Dangerous?

53
00:03:10,988 --> 00:03:13,279
See you tomorrow at twelve.

54
00:03:13,363 --> 00:03:15,029
- On the dot.
- Yeah.

55
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:17,071
- Yeah, don't be late, okay?
- Okay.

56
00:03:17,154 --> 00:03:20,446
- You got all the equipment?
- Yeah. All good.

57
00:03:20,529 --> 00:03:23,363
- Okay. Perfect. Thank you.
- But... Hey.

58
00:03:23,446 --> 00:03:25,821
- Are we, uh... taking the boat out?
- Huh?

59
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:27,696
While we're there?

60
00:03:27,779 --> 00:03:30,696
No, we're not taking the boat out.
What the hell are you talking about?

61
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:33,654
No! No boat. You forget
why we're going there?

62
00:03:34,404 --> 00:03:38,154
TÃ˜YEN "SENI-WHORE" CENTER

63
00:03:38,196 --> 00:03:39,436
How are things with Lisa?

64
00:03:40,404 --> 00:03:41,529
Lisa's Lisa.

65
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:42,738
She's good.

66
00:03:44,238 --> 00:03:49,279
We're headed to the summerhouse
for a little R and R. A break.

67
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:52,613
- A break from what?
- Don't start, Dad.

68
00:03:52,696 --> 00:03:56,404
When's this TV shit gonna end, huh?
You're not gonna be the next Hitchcock.

69
00:03:56,488 --> 00:03:59,154
- When will you get...
- Areal job, like you had?

70
00:03:59,738 --> 00:04:01,404
Look where it got
you. Well done.

71
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:03,696
I drove that bus to
provide for my family.

72
00:04:03,779 --> 00:04:06,988
For you and your mother. Oh,
and I built that summerhouse.

73
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:10,529
Lisa's...

74
00:04:12,571 --> 00:04:15,363
She's decided to go
hiking in the mountains.

75
00:04:16,321 --> 00:04:19,654
Planning this whole walk
into the... the mountains,

76
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,363
all alone.

77
00:04:22,154 --> 00:04:23,904
You know, it's dangerous.

78
00:04:23,988 --> 00:04:28,238
There's snow and ice. I've
told her to be careful there.

79
00:04:31,113 --> 00:04:32,113
Dangerous.

80
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:36,571
I loved that house.

81
00:04:38,488 --> 00:04:42,279
A beer, a hammock.
Looking out on the lake.

82
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:45,363
Hear the wind in the trees. Huh?

83
00:04:46,113 --> 00:04:47,113
Yeah.

84
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:50,029
- I designed it myself, did you know?
- Really?

85
00:04:50,113 --> 00:04:52,654
Yeah. The architect wanted
to turn the cabin around, right?

86
00:04:52,738 --> 00:04:56,154
I said to him, "It's much
nicer to see the sun come up,

87
00:04:56,238 --> 00:04:57,696
- that..."
- Than to see it go down?

88
00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:00,363
- Yeah, because it gives you hope.
- Mm-hm.

89
00:05:00,446 --> 00:05:03,279
You know, that's the problem
with your whole generation.

90
00:05:03,363 --> 00:05:06,071
All you fuckers,
nothing is ever enough.

91
00:05:06,696 --> 00:05:11,529
What good a war would have
done you. All you sorry fuckers.

92
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:13,446
So war is good?

93
00:05:14,654 --> 00:05:17,363
- Certainly made me a man.
- Uh-huh?

94
00:05:17,446 --> 00:05:20,113
A man isn't something
born. Men are made.

95
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:22,488
They're something forged,
something hardened.

96
00:05:23,154 --> 00:05:25,238
By pain. Great suffering.

97
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:26,821
And by blood.

98
00:05:28,904 --> 00:05:30,446
Jesus Christ.

99
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:32,654
Fuck. I should have
kicked the bucket there.

100
00:05:32,738 --> 00:05:34,446
I shouldn't be sitting here.

101
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:36,238
I can't die like this.

102
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:39,321
Not here. Not like this.

103
00:06:19,904 --> 00:06:21,779
- Oh, hey!
- Hey, Lars.

104
00:06:21,863 --> 00:06:23,238
- Doing good?
- Yeah.

105
00:06:23,321 --> 00:06:24,321
That's good.

106
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:26,363
- Happy hunting!
- Huh?

107
00:06:40,113 --> 00:06:42,071
Hey! Ready for the cabin?

108
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:43,779
Yeah.

109
00:06:53,738 --> 00:06:56,196
You park so damn
close to this fence.

110
00:06:58,071 --> 00:07:04,654
IN BAD TIMES

111
00:08:33,154 --> 00:08:34,863
What are you doing? Huh?

112
00:08:36,696 --> 00:08:39,238
Oh, it was on sale.

113
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:42,380
- I wasn't worried.
- Oh, I know you weren't.

114
00:08:42,404 --> 00:08:43,238
No, I wasn't.

115
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:46,613
No, I know we can't afford to buy
nice wine. That's why I don't do it, okay?

116
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:50,738
Can we just forget about all
of this and just relax, okay?

117
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:51,946
- Okay.
- Mm-hm. Thanks.

118
00:08:59,154 --> 00:09:00,154
Is that the new play

119
00:09:00,238 --> 00:09:01,779
- you're auditioning for?
- Mm-hm.

120
00:09:01,863 --> 00:09:04,071
- Any good?
- It's okay.

121
00:09:07,738 --> 00:09:08,946
Ah, you'll get the role.

122
00:09:11,696 --> 00:09:12,696
I'm not so sure..

123
00:09:13,488 --> 00:09:15,613
The director is
supposed to be a...

124
00:09:16,446 --> 00:09:17,779
pretentious bastard.

125
00:09:17,863 --> 00:09:20,238
- That's the whole point of our job.
- Mm-hm.

126
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,113
But this guy's a
theater director.

127
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:35,279
- What are you saying?
- Nothing, nothing.

128
00:09:36,613 --> 00:09:38,113
Because I direct TV, right?

129
00:09:38,196 --> 00:09:39,863
When you direct TV.

130
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:42,863
I am directing TV, though.

131
00:09:42,946 --> 00:09:44,946
- And I got home early.
- A soap opera, right?

132
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:47,529
Oh, yeah? And when was
your last job, then, Meryl?

133
00:09:48,904 --> 00:09:51,529
"Side effects can include
drowsiness, dizziness, diarrhea

134
00:09:51,613 --> 00:09:54,529
- and thoughts of suicide."
- Don't talk like the crap you do's better.

135
00:09:54,613 --> 00:09:57,071
That crap I do pays our
credit card bills, in fact.

136
00:09:57,154 --> 00:09:59,738
- I am so tired of arguing with you!
- So then don't!

137
00:10:02,863 --> 00:10:04,738
When we get there, I'm
gonna lie in the hammock

138
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:07,238
- and not move for the whole weekend.
- That's great.

139
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:09,404
Learn this part, and
drink some wine...

140
00:10:09,946 --> 00:10:13,029
Only reason I will ever
move is to go to the fridge.

141
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,946
Or to go watch some TV.

142
00:10:22,904 --> 00:10:25,024
I wasn't trying to say he's
better than you, he's not.

143
00:10:25,071 --> 00:10:26,613
He's just different. You're...

144
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:31,613
You're an amazing director.

145
00:10:35,946 --> 00:10:38,071
Uh-huh. We both know
that's some bullshit.

146
00:11:02,321 --> 00:11:04,113
What the fuck?

147
00:11:05,446 --> 00:11:06,446
What is it?

148
00:11:07,196 --> 00:11:08,779
Doesn't fucking work.

149
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:16,946
Honey, I'm home!

150
00:11:25,196 --> 00:11:27,488
Home, sweet home.

151
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:46,529
BASIL

152
00:13:16,154 --> 00:13:17,634
Have you seen my wool sweater?

153
00:13:18,363 --> 00:13:19,196
Which one?

154
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,696
The one I'm always
wearing when I'm here.

155
00:13:22,488 --> 00:13:25,863
The one I like, with the stripes,
you know, that I wear when I'm here.

156
00:13:26,446 --> 00:13:27,863
It's not in the closet?

157
00:13:29,904 --> 00:13:31,696
I looked there, obviously.

158
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:37,363
No, haven't seen it.

159
00:13:37,446 --> 00:13:40,488
Hey, you can't... It's important
that they're not too thick.

160
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:43,404
That they're not that thick.
Make them thinner, okay?

161
00:13:47,571 --> 00:13:48,571
Okay.

162
00:13:52,196 --> 00:13:54,279
Hey, don't, don't.
Don't turn it down now!

163
00:13:54,363 --> 00:13:56,988
But it's way too hot. Look
at that. You'll burn them.

164
00:13:57,071 --> 00:13:59,613
No. The butter's supposed
to be like that. Crackling.

165
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:08,404
- Oh, come on, can't you just...
- Hey!

166
00:14:08,488 --> 00:14:09,728
- ...put them in the pan?
- Aah!

167
00:14:11,488 --> 00:14:12,529
Okay.

168
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:23,654
What do you think?

169
00:14:25,363 --> 00:14:26,363
It's good.

170
00:14:28,196 --> 00:14:30,154
I got Arvid to cut them for me.

171
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:35,279
They don't have New York strip at
the store, so I had to draw it for him.

172
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:40,696
- You drew the steak for him?
- Mm-hm.

173
00:14:45,363 --> 00:14:46,363
What's up?

174
00:14:47,904 --> 00:14:51,738
I think it's... fascinating how
much time you can spend on...

175
00:14:51,821 --> 00:14:54,154
On us having a nice
meal and a nice night?

176
00:14:54,821 --> 00:14:56,113
Of course. I'll do that.

177
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:06,946
When's your audition, huh?

178
00:15:09,821 --> 00:15:10,821
On Tuesday.

179
00:15:12,363 --> 00:15:13,988
If you're ready? All good?

180
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:16,422
There's a lot I've got
to memorize, but...

181
00:15:16,446 --> 00:15:18,571
- Well, what a great place to do it.
- Mm-hm.

182
00:15:28,488 --> 00:15:29,738
That, um... other thing?

183
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:35,779
- What other thing?
- That, uh... that, um...

184
00:15:36,446 --> 00:15:39,279
That thing, um... that
thing you're writing.

185
00:15:39,363 --> 00:15:41,363
You and that guy
from your acting class.

186
00:15:41,446 --> 00:15:42,863
- What's his name?
- Diego.

187
00:15:42,946 --> 00:15:44,279
- What's his name? Diego?
- Mm-hm.

188
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:47,988
So, how's that?

189
00:15:48,071 --> 00:15:49,988
It's going well.
I think it'll work.

190
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:51,529
Great.

191
00:15:52,154 --> 00:15:53,654
Is it rough?

192
00:15:54,863 --> 00:15:55,863
Is it hard?

193
00:16:03,988 --> 00:16:05,821
It's good to write
your own material.

194
00:16:08,363 --> 00:16:09,446
Smart.

195
00:16:10,946 --> 00:16:12,029
Okay.

196
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,821
That's one, two, three...

197
00:16:15,613 --> 00:16:17,613
four, five, six, seven...

198
00:16:18,071 --> 00:16:19,404
eight, and nine.

199
00:16:32,863 --> 00:16:35,488
Gurka. Cucumber.
Triple score, bitch.

200
00:16:35,571 --> 00:16:38,029
- 54 points.
- Like fuck it is.

201
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:41,904
- What?
- You can't use a Swedish word.

202
00:16:42,446 --> 00:16:45,613
It's "agurk" in
Norwegian. A-G-U-R-K.

203
00:16:47,238 --> 00:16:51,071
- How come Swedish isn't allowed now?
- It's the Norwegian edition of the game.

204
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:54,988
If Swedish was allowed, it'd
be a Swedish box and rules.

205
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:57,446
- Well, I'm doing it. They're my points.
- Then you lose.

206
00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:00,113
- Are you serious?
- Of course I'm serious.

207
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:07,279
- Okay. I'm over it.
- Well, then it's "agurk".

208
00:17:07,363 --> 00:17:12,321
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
18... 18 points. "Agurk".

209
00:17:15,154 --> 00:17:16,238
You tired?

210
00:17:18,488 --> 00:17:20,154
You get tired when
you lose, huh?

211
00:17:26,904 --> 00:17:28,446
Go upstairs, I'll clean up.

212
00:17:32,696 --> 00:17:33,696
Good night.

213
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:37,529
Are we going to continue playing
tomorrow, or do you give up?

214
00:17:37,613 --> 00:17:39,988
You're really far
behind, you know.

215
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:43,738
We'll play tomorrow.

216
00:17:47,113 --> 00:17:48,113
Night, then.

217
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:16,988
Come on, now. Come on.

218
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:22,154
Come on.

219
00:20:22,863 --> 00:20:23,863
Lars?

220
00:20:26,154 --> 00:20:28,321
- Yeah?
- Can you come over here?

221
00:20:30,071 --> 00:20:31,613
I can come, yeah. I'm coming.

222
00:20:54,738 --> 00:20:55,988
What's wrong?

223
00:20:58,238 --> 00:20:59,571
I need some help in here.

224
00:22:14,113 --> 00:22:15,654
What were you doing with this?

225
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:19,238
- The hammer?
- Mm-hm.

226
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:24,446
I was... gonna fix the roof.
Those roof things. You know?

227
00:22:26,071 --> 00:22:28,113
Roof things?

228
00:22:31,738 --> 00:22:32,738
The shingles?

229
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:35,904
- Yeah. The shingles.
- Uh-huh. Uh, yeah, yeah.

230
00:22:40,238 --> 00:22:41,238
And this one?

231
00:22:48,904 --> 00:22:51,154
- What are you doing?
- What were they for, huh?

232
00:22:53,571 --> 00:22:56,988
What about the rocks in the
boat? What were they for?

233
00:22:59,654 --> 00:23:01,904
I saw what you were doing
by the edge of the forest.

234
00:23:01,988 --> 00:23:04,988
What are you talking about?
Why'd you zap me with a Taser?

235
00:23:32,738 --> 00:23:34,071
Ah, fuck.

236
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:40,529
Lisa, stop it. Come on! Hey!

237
00:23:40,613 --> 00:23:41,613
Stop it.

238
00:23:44,238 --> 00:23:47,071
If I was to guess, I'd say you
were going to take the hammer,

239
00:23:47,154 --> 00:23:50,363
hit me on the head, tie me
up, take me out in the boat

240
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:53,363
and sink me in the
lake with those rocks.

241
00:23:53,988 --> 00:23:55,779
Warmer?

242
00:23:59,696 --> 00:24:01,029
The thing that I...

243
00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:04,279
don't understand is, um...

244
00:24:04,821 --> 00:24:06,321
what was the saw for?

245
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:19,738
Bodies float. So I was
going to cut you into pieces.

246
00:24:23,488 --> 00:24:25,321
What?

247
00:24:26,321 --> 00:24:29,988
No! What? Lars!

248
00:24:30,071 --> 00:24:32,779
You were gonna... you
were gonna dissect me?

249
00:24:36,488 --> 00:24:39,571
You? You can't
even hold a raw steak.

250
00:24:44,946 --> 00:24:47,154
But, I mean, what...
What were you thinking?

251
00:24:47,238 --> 00:24:48,988
What were you
going to tell people?

252
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:53,529
That Lisa just went for a walk,
that she never came home?

253
00:25:00,363 --> 00:25:01,988
No... No!

254
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:07,113
Are you kidding me?
That was your plan?

255
00:25:11,571 --> 00:25:13,738
Oh! You're so fucking stupid.

256
00:25:17,446 --> 00:25:20,529
But hey... What I really...

257
00:25:21,488 --> 00:25:24,654
really, really want
to know, is what for.

258
00:25:26,446 --> 00:25:29,488
What kind of idiotic motive
do you have to murder me?

259
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:33,363
Let's start off with you being a
lying bitch and a two-timing whore.

260
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:45,238
- When'd you realize?
- When I got home one evening.

261
00:25:45,321 --> 00:25:47,571
You were rehearsing with
that classmate of yours.

262
00:25:47,654 --> 00:25:50,071
And I saw it wasn't
lines he was feeding you.

263
00:25:50,154 --> 00:25:53,446
So you were going to beat me to
death with a hammer and cut me up

264
00:25:53,529 --> 00:25:55,071
because of Diego?

265
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:57,988
Because I'm screwing
someone else?

266
00:26:01,363 --> 00:26:03,363
Okay, but take a
second and think.

267
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:06,363
Think hard. I know
it's difficult for you,

268
00:26:06,446 --> 00:26:08,946
there's not much going
on up there, but try.

269
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:11,738
When's the last
time we fucked? Hm?

270
00:26:16,863 --> 00:26:20,988
When's the last time you satisfied me,
Mr. "Two humps and I'm going to sleep"?

271
00:26:21,071 --> 00:26:22,071
Fucking whore.

272
00:26:23,363 --> 00:26:24,946
I can't say that I'm surprised.

273
00:26:26,154 --> 00:26:30,029
An idiotic motive, an
idiotic plan, an idiotic man.

274
00:26:31,363 --> 00:26:32,529
My plan, however...

275
00:26:35,821 --> 00:26:37,779
It's on a whole other level.

276
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:39,529
What was your plan, then?

277
00:26:40,404 --> 00:26:41,404
Not was.

278
00:26:42,238 --> 00:26:43,238
Is.

279
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:45,113
Hunting?

280
00:26:45,196 --> 00:26:46,071
ONE DAY EARLIER

281
00:26:46,154 --> 00:26:47,238
- Yeah.
- You?

282
00:26:47,321 --> 00:26:48,863
You know I hate guns.

283
00:26:48,946 --> 00:26:52,863
But he was like, "Come on, Lisa.
It's something we can do as a couple."

284
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:56,154
- But you can't even shoot, right?
- No, but Lars can.

285
00:26:56,238 --> 00:26:58,946
- So it can't be too tricky, huh?
- Excuse me, Ms. Lisa?

286
00:26:59,821 --> 00:27:01,904
I'm done with the
leaves, so I'm heading out.

287
00:27:01,988 --> 00:27:04,113
Oh, thanks, Victor. I'll
send you the money.

288
00:27:04,196 --> 00:27:05,363
Thank you so much.

289
00:27:05,446 --> 00:27:07,279
- See you later.
- See you soon.

290
00:27:07,988 --> 00:27:08,988
Really soon.

291
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:14,821
He does some odd jobs for us,

292
00:27:15,613 --> 00:27:17,071
of the easier sort.

293
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:21,279
I can't get over
your hair. It's...

294
00:27:21,363 --> 00:27:22,779
- Yeah.
- You went blonde.

295
00:27:22,863 --> 00:27:24,321
Yeah, it was for a role.

296
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:27,571
- An audition.
- So, did you book it?

297
00:27:29,529 --> 00:27:30,529
No.

298
00:27:31,196 --> 00:27:32,779
No.

299
00:27:32,863 --> 00:27:34,279
Your time will come.

300
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:38,696
You only need one good
role. That's what Lars says.

301
00:27:39,654 --> 00:27:40,654
Yeah.

302
00:27:41,446 --> 00:27:42,863
That's what he says.

303
00:27:48,613 --> 00:27:49,863
- Happy hunting.
- Huh?

304
00:27:52,738 --> 00:27:56,196
We're hunting in the forest. I
didn't really want to come, but...

305
00:27:58,654 --> 00:27:59,863
you convinced me.

306
00:28:00,654 --> 00:28:02,696
I hate the thought of
guns. Everyone knows it.

307
00:28:04,738 --> 00:28:07,654
So... I'm walking
behind you, and I...

308
00:28:08,738 --> 00:28:09,821
I stumble.

309
00:28:11,321 --> 00:28:12,529
And boom...

310
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:14,779
"No!"

311
00:28:15,446 --> 00:28:16,863
"No! Oh, my God!"

312
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:20,488
"What a tragic
accident. So awful."

313
00:28:21,571 --> 00:28:22,904
Okay.

314
00:28:23,946 --> 00:28:24,946
I get it.

315
00:28:25,613 --> 00:28:26,904
- What?
- No, it's just that

316
00:28:26,988 --> 00:28:28,821
this is where your
plan falls apart.

317
00:28:30,071 --> 00:28:32,029
- How so?
- Because, Lisa...

318
00:28:32,738 --> 00:28:37,071
Because you're a terrible,
awful, horrible actor.

319
00:28:38,113 --> 00:28:41,071
You can't even act your
way out of a speeding ticket.

320
00:28:41,154 --> 00:28:43,154
You can't even fake
an orgasm, can you?

321
00:28:43,238 --> 00:28:46,113
All that screaming and
godawful groaning you keep doin'?

322
00:28:46,196 --> 00:28:49,279
I'm sure even Diego,
as stupid, stupid as he is,

323
00:28:49,363 --> 00:28:51,363
even he knows you're just lying.

324
00:28:55,404 --> 00:28:56,779
Think of five years ago.

325
00:28:58,488 --> 00:29:02,863
When I said to follow your
dreams and move to Norway?

326
00:29:06,654 --> 00:29:09,279
I was lying... through my teeth.

327
00:29:09,863 --> 00:29:11,279
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you!

328
00:29:12,363 --> 00:29:16,279
You swallowed that whole fuckin' line,
didn't you? You believed me entirely!

329
00:29:16,363 --> 00:29:17,738
And you know why?

330
00:29:17,821 --> 00:29:20,863
It's because I am so much
better of an actor than you.

331
00:29:20,946 --> 00:29:22,529
- Nah.
- Yeah, I am.

332
00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:27,863
You're a fucking bitter,
useless, fourth-rate director.

333
00:29:28,446 --> 00:29:31,779
Think of that movie you were gonna
do. Of course you were gonna fuck it up...

334
00:29:31,863 --> 00:29:34,529
- The deal fell apart!
- So you just give up, then?

335
00:29:34,613 --> 00:29:37,738
At least I had something to give up
on, Ms. "Side effects can include..."

336
00:29:37,821 --> 00:29:40,488
Just stop and look at that
stupid blonde hair of yours.

337
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:42,654
Do you think you'll get
more roles with that?

338
00:29:42,738 --> 00:29:44,488
What's next for you, huh? Botox?

339
00:29:45,613 --> 00:29:46,654
Or silicone?

340
00:29:48,488 --> 00:29:51,488
- Actually, that might be for the best...
- Hey, fuck you!

341
00:29:51,571 --> 00:29:53,451
- Yeah, fuck you.
- As if you're so much better.

342
00:29:53,488 --> 00:29:54,821
- I am.
- Remember that...

343
00:29:54,904 --> 00:29:57,321
What's was her name?
That dumb actress. Danielle!

344
00:29:57,404 --> 00:29:59,529
- Who said the director told her...
- Oh, my God!

345
00:29:59,613 --> 00:30:02,488
- Are you starting this again?
- Told her to take off her top

346
00:30:02,571 --> 00:30:06,654
- so he could get a look at her breasts.
- That was some "Me Too" bullshit, okay?

347
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,904
First of all, she was
auditioning for a stripper,

348
00:30:08,988 --> 00:30:11,672
- I needed to see if she was comfortable...
- You needed to see if...

349
00:30:11,696 --> 00:30:14,404
You're so creepy.
Creepy and boring!

350
00:30:14,988 --> 00:30:16,404
Every time I listen
to your advice,

351
00:30:16,488 --> 00:30:17,696
- it goes to hell.
- Hm.

352
00:30:18,613 --> 00:30:21,238
You were the one who told
me to move to Norway for work.

353
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:24,404
- I was lying, you talentless fucking tit!
- Enough!

354
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:29,571
Now, we're gonna get dressed and
go for a long, long walk in the forest,

355
00:30:29,654 --> 00:30:31,734
that ends up with me blowing
your head off your neck.

356
00:30:31,779 --> 00:30:32,863
I'm good, thanks.

357
00:30:35,696 --> 00:30:36,988
- You're good?
- Yeah.

358
00:30:40,154 --> 00:30:42,779
You cunt!

359
00:30:45,529 --> 00:30:47,988
You're so fucking pathetic.

360
00:30:48,821 --> 00:30:50,488
If you don't do what I tell you,

361
00:30:50,571 --> 00:30:53,488
I'll take your little hammer
and shove it up your ass.

362
00:30:53,571 --> 00:30:55,488
Nothing is going
into my ass today.

363
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:57,279
Absolutely nothing.

364
00:30:58,446 --> 00:31:01,071
- You're sure about it?
- Oh, yeah. I'm sure about it.

365
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:08,321
What the hell took you so long?

366
00:31:11,321 --> 00:31:13,696
FIVE DAYS EARLIER

367
00:31:18,488 --> 00:31:19,488
Want some?

368
00:31:20,821 --> 00:31:23,529
No, I'm all right. I'm
not five years old.

369
00:31:27,946 --> 00:31:29,363
Why are we meeting here?

370
00:31:30,696 --> 00:31:33,238
I thought it would be less
suspicious, you know?

371
00:31:33,321 --> 00:31:35,529
It's like how secret
agents would meet.

372
00:31:35,613 --> 00:31:38,071
Okay. Two adults,
alone at a carnival?

373
00:31:38,946 --> 00:31:41,571
Or two secret agents
who are also pedophiles?

374
00:31:41,654 --> 00:31:42,774
You're the one who needs me.

375
00:31:43,821 --> 00:31:47,321
Yeah, 'cause there's one
thing I won't... can't do.

376
00:31:47,904 --> 00:31:51,238
Yeah, and I don't get it. That's
the easy part, I mean, after it's over.

377
00:31:51,321 --> 00:31:54,779
- It's like cleaning a reindeer.
- Good. We're playing to our strengths.

378
00:31:55,696 --> 00:31:58,863
But, um... I was wondering
about my compensation.

379
00:31:58,946 --> 00:32:00,696
The compensation?
What do you mean?

380
00:32:01,488 --> 00:32:05,279
Her policy is for a million. You
get 500,000 and we move on.

381
00:32:06,821 --> 00:32:08,321
I want it in writing.

382
00:32:09,904 --> 00:32:12,363
You want it In writing?
You want a contract?

383
00:32:12,446 --> 00:32:16,488
A written document detailing how we're
going to murder and and dismember my wife?

384
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:17,988
That's what you want?

385
00:32:18,696 --> 00:32:20,571
- Yeah.
- Ever heard of evidence?

386
00:32:21,654 --> 00:32:23,154
Ever heard of "moron" before?

387
00:32:24,363 --> 00:32:26,863
- I just want to be professional.
- Be there at 12.

388
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:31,154
On the dot. Oh, and thanks so
much for finding time in your schedule.

389
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:34,821
Goddamn snob.

390
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:38,904
Like I don't have a
schedule. Of course...

391
00:32:39,821 --> 00:32:41,404
Of course I have a schedule.

392
00:32:52,446 --> 00:32:54,363
Morning.

393
00:32:55,446 --> 00:32:56,904
Her face looks weird.

394
00:32:56,988 --> 00:33:01,029
I think that's pretty common when
someone smashes your head in with a shovel.

395
00:33:03,113 --> 00:33:04,113
Sit down.

396
00:33:13,946 --> 00:33:15,154
What?

397
00:33:16,571 --> 00:33:19,488
What the fuck? Lars.

398
00:33:19,571 --> 00:33:21,488
- Fuck, are you serious?
- What?

399
00:33:21,988 --> 00:33:24,029
You really dragged
Victor into this?

400
00:33:24,113 --> 00:33:26,029
Hey. Hey, Ms. Lisa.

401
00:33:27,321 --> 00:33:29,821
I mean, Victor? Stupid Victor.

402
00:33:29,904 --> 00:33:31,154
- Idiot Victor...
- Hey!

403
00:33:31,238 --> 00:33:32,488
- What?
- Don't call me that.

404
00:33:45,488 --> 00:33:46,821
So the thinking is...

405
00:33:47,946 --> 00:33:49,613
that Victor is going to kill me.

406
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:51,946
No.

407
00:33:53,196 --> 00:33:55,863
It's not like that. Since
Lars thinks it's gross,

408
00:33:55,946 --> 00:33:57,446
we said that I
would do the cleanup

409
00:33:57,529 --> 00:33:58,988
- if he does the...
- Hello.

410
00:33:59,863 --> 00:34:02,571
- My job is to cut you to pieces.
- Hey, let's just shut up.

411
00:34:03,988 --> 00:34:07,654
Ah. Of course you
can't do it yourself.

412
00:34:07,738 --> 00:34:09,154
You fucking chickenshit.

413
00:34:09,238 --> 00:34:11,738
- Shut your mouth! Both of you, stop!
- You're a pathetic fool.

414
00:34:11,821 --> 00:34:13,363
Just stop. It's my turn.

415
00:34:19,363 --> 00:34:20,738
You're going to answer me, Lisa.

416
00:34:22,404 --> 00:34:25,321
What the hell kind of
reason can you have

417
00:34:25,404 --> 00:34:26,571
to kill me?

418
00:34:27,446 --> 00:34:28,654
I'm ready for it.

419
00:34:28,738 --> 00:34:31,863
You mean apart from
being a pathetic waste of life?

420
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,529
Yeah, apart from that. Mm.

421
00:34:35,613 --> 00:34:37,613
You're an irresponsible
gambling addict

422
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,863
who buried our entire
lives under his debts.

423
00:34:39,946 --> 00:34:41,696
Oh, yeah, right. Fuck it.

424
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,488
"Just quit your job, Lisa."

425
00:34:44,113 --> 00:34:47,238
"I'll take care of you. My
salary's enough for the both of us."

426
00:34:47,321 --> 00:34:48,361
- And it was!
- Yeah, yeah.

427
00:34:48,404 --> 00:34:51,904
You did all right for a few years, before
people realized what a hack you are.

428
00:34:53,071 --> 00:34:56,279
- Talentless fucking garbage.
- Garbage?

429
00:34:56,363 --> 00:34:57,196
You do realize

430
00:34:57,279 --> 00:34:59,488
that we'll lose it all
in two more months?

431
00:35:00,071 --> 00:35:02,946
The house, and the car, and
the cabin your father built for you.

432
00:35:03,029 --> 00:35:04,949
- You just keep going like it's all fine.
- What?

433
00:35:05,029 --> 00:35:05,904
Expensive wines,

434
00:35:05,988 --> 00:35:08,547
- and New York fucking steak.
- What do you mean, we'll lose it all?

435
00:35:08,571 --> 00:35:11,529
I bought the car. I
bought our house.

436
00:35:11,613 --> 00:35:14,946
Oh, and I got this
summerhouse from my father.

437
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,779
- No, Lars. No, no.
- Oh, yeah.

438
00:35:16,863 --> 00:35:19,154
You know, when you get
married, you share your belongings.

439
00:35:19,238 --> 00:35:22,571
What's yours is mine, and what's
mine is yours. So it's also mine!

440
00:35:37,654 --> 00:35:38,654
Oh, I get it.

441
00:35:44,029 --> 00:35:45,696
You want the life insurance.

442
00:35:46,738 --> 00:35:48,446
You were gonna
kill me so you could...

443
00:35:48,529 --> 00:35:50,279
- Be free.
- Be free?

444
00:35:51,196 --> 00:35:52,029
Okay.

445
00:35:52,113 --> 00:35:55,321
Get far away from here
and never look back again.

446
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,279
Huh. It's kind of funny.

447
00:36:00,863 --> 00:36:02,821
- What?
- Uh, it's just...

448
00:36:02,904 --> 00:36:04,613
- What is?
- Nothing. You shut it.

449
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:07,279
- It's also the life insurance we wanna...
- Hey.

450
00:36:07,863 --> 00:36:08,988
...uh, kill you for.

451
00:36:19,738 --> 00:36:20,738
Diego.

452
00:36:21,404 --> 00:36:23,904
- Well, it didn't help your case.
- I get half.

453
00:36:24,821 --> 00:36:25,946
Five hundred thousand.

454
00:36:27,404 --> 00:36:29,946
- I'm buying a new RV.
- Sorry, wait a minute. How much?

455
00:36:30,029 --> 00:36:32,196
- Nice two-bedroom model.
- Hey, Victor. Listen to me.

456
00:36:32,279 --> 00:36:35,196
- That policy is for three million!
- Let's all just shut up!

457
00:36:35,279 --> 00:36:38,071
Shut up, now.
Keep it shut. Yeah.

458
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,488
Fuck, I can't wait to get
rid of your nagging voice.

459
00:36:40,571 --> 00:36:42,571
I'll never hear it again.
Give me the hammer.

460
00:36:45,654 --> 00:36:46,654
Give me the hammer.

461
00:36:49,488 --> 00:36:51,529
- Hey. Stop it.
- Let her talk.

462
00:36:52,571 --> 00:36:54,891
- I wanna hear her out.
- Can't we... Okay. You'll hear it.

463
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:57,227
- But I need... Give me the hammer.
- Just let her finish.

464
00:36:57,863 --> 00:36:59,738
- Stop joking.
- Move, yeah?

465
00:36:59,821 --> 00:37:01,571
- Give me the hammer.
- Move!

466
00:37:05,279 --> 00:37:06,279
Hey!

467
00:37:06,363 --> 00:37:07,363
Careful.

468
00:37:07,946 --> 00:37:08,946
Fuck you.

469
00:37:13,571 --> 00:37:15,488
The insurance is
worth three million.

470
00:37:16,779 --> 00:37:19,279
Do you hear that?
You'll get half of mine.

471
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:22,029
- A million and a half, if you shoot him.
- Shut your mouth!

472
00:37:22,113 --> 00:37:24,113
- Shoot him! Come on, do it.
- Shut it!

473
00:37:24,196 --> 00:37:26,738
Two million if you blow
her head off right now.

474
00:37:26,821 --> 00:37:28,821
- Lars, go die in a fucking hole.
- Now! Do it!

475
00:37:28,904 --> 00:37:31,154
- You're gonna die!
- You get three million, everything,

476
00:37:31,238 --> 00:37:33,279
- if you shoot him!
- And now she's lying.

477
00:37:33,363 --> 00:37:35,404
- Look at her shitty lying.
- You lie all the time.

478
00:37:35,488 --> 00:37:37,255
- I'm so fucking tired of you!
- You're a liar!

479
00:37:37,279 --> 00:37:39,696
Give me it! Now! Get off!

480
00:37:45,613 --> 00:37:48,238
Let go of the fucking shotgun!

481
00:37:51,196 --> 00:37:52,988
- Let go!
- I want half of it!

482
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:54,821
I said you're
getting everything!

483
00:37:54,904 --> 00:37:56,279
Retarded idiot!

484
00:38:06,738 --> 00:38:08,404
Oh... No, no, no...

485
00:38:08,488 --> 00:38:10,488
- No, no, no...
- Oh, my fucking God!

486
00:38:12,321 --> 00:38:14,279
No!

487
00:38:16,529 --> 00:38:18,154
- Victor!
- How...

488
00:38:18,238 --> 00:38:19,547
- Shit!
- How does it look?

489
00:38:19,571 --> 00:38:21,047
- Not optimal, I'd say.
- Oh, my God...

490
00:38:21,071 --> 00:38:24,363
- You shot his whole hand off.
- Can you please calm the fuck down?

491
00:38:24,446 --> 00:38:26,404
- Calm down?
- Yeah, calm down!

492
00:38:27,029 --> 00:38:29,529
- Do something!
- I'm trying to figure out what to do.

493
00:38:29,613 --> 00:38:32,071
- But you won't shut your mouth!
- Take him to the hospital.

494
00:38:32,154 --> 00:38:34,196
- Are you crazy?
- Before he bleeds to death!

495
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:36,488
- I have to run!
- He's losing blood!

496
00:38:36,571 --> 00:38:39,238
- Hospital!
- Do something! You have to stop him!

497
00:39:00,654 --> 00:39:01,738
Fuck.

498
00:39:01,821 --> 00:39:04,113
- What the hell have you done?
- I, uh...

499
00:39:06,946 --> 00:39:09,446
You said - you
said to stop... stop...

500
00:39:12,404 --> 00:39:14,113
Stop the bleeding.

501
00:39:15,321 --> 00:39:17,779
Stop the bleeding, Lars.

502
00:39:21,863 --> 00:39:23,779
What the fuck is wrong with you?

503
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:28,321
Fuck it. What's another murder?

504
00:39:29,363 --> 00:39:30,738
What?

505
00:39:32,529 --> 00:39:33,863
No, I don't think so.

506
00:39:37,071 --> 00:39:39,488
It's a two-barrel
shotgun, dumbfuck.

507
00:39:43,071 --> 00:39:44,571
I'll have to reload, then.

508
00:39:57,779 --> 00:39:59,738
Fuck!

509
00:40:00,321 --> 00:40:02,488
Come on...

510
00:40:13,529 --> 00:40:15,613
Come here!

511
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:10,446
THREE DAYS EARLIER

512
00:42:23,488 --> 00:42:27,321
We're hungry too, but we're not stopping
to eat berries that might be poisonous.

513
00:42:27,404 --> 00:42:28,404
I need food.

514
00:42:31,779 --> 00:42:33,821
You can't function at all,
you fucking lump of meat.

515
00:43:08,029 --> 00:43:09,196
Oh, fuck.

516
00:44:36,196 --> 00:44:39,988
We'll stay here a few days till things
are quiet, then we'll push forward.

517
00:44:40,863 --> 00:44:42,238
See if we can find a vehicle.

518
00:44:42,988 --> 00:44:44,488
Looking like this?

519
00:44:53,321 --> 00:44:55,571
The fuck kind of
clothes are these, huh?

520
00:44:55,654 --> 00:44:58,279
I think they're quite
nice. Look at this sweater.

521
00:45:03,154 --> 00:45:04,488
Oh, no.

522
00:45:07,363 --> 00:45:08,363
Fuck.

523
00:45:08,738 --> 00:45:09,738
Is that...

524
00:45:10,654 --> 00:45:12,071
Are they coming in here?

525
00:45:12,154 --> 00:45:13,779
Son of a bitch.

526
00:45:13,863 --> 00:45:15,363
We'll get 'em. Let's crush 'em.

527
00:45:16,738 --> 00:45:17,779
What if more are coming?

528
00:45:19,279 --> 00:45:20,599
We can't risk it.

529
00:45:26,029 --> 00:45:27,113
Come here.

530
00:45:39,238 --> 00:45:41,488
Honey, I'm home!

531
00:46:04,988 --> 00:46:06,738
Nice. Mmm.

532
00:46:06,821 --> 00:46:07,821
Petter!

533
00:46:11,238 --> 00:46:12,946
Should have taken the meatballs.

534
00:46:14,071 --> 00:46:16,321
Those aren't the
balls I'm looking for.

535
00:46:17,363 --> 00:46:18,571
If you know what I mean.

536
00:46:20,696 --> 00:46:23,029
Of course I know what you mean.

537
00:46:24,446 --> 00:46:26,446
You think you're discreet,
that you're subtle?

538
00:46:26,529 --> 00:46:28,571
You're horny, okay? I get it.

539
00:46:30,196 --> 00:46:32,488
Now shut up,
I'm trying to think.

540
00:46:32,571 --> 00:46:34,363
- Petter!
- We can't use that ladder.

541
00:46:34,446 --> 00:46:36,446
It's too noisy and
they'll hear us.

542
00:46:37,279 --> 00:46:38,779
Petter! Please.

543
00:46:38,863 --> 00:46:40,363
What the fuck is it now?

544
00:46:41,363 --> 00:46:44,654
- My stomach hurts.
- You have an upset stomach?

545
00:46:47,363 --> 00:46:49,654
Why do you have an
upset stomach, you think?

546
00:46:51,363 --> 00:46:54,071
Try to think, Roy. Why do you
think you have an upset stomach?

547
00:46:54,154 --> 00:46:56,821
- Maybe... maybe it's, uh...
- Maybe it's, uh...

548
00:46:58,863 --> 00:47:00,113
Maybe it's the berries.

549
00:47:00,196 --> 00:47:03,113
Yeah, the berries. You think?

550
00:47:06,654 --> 00:47:07,779
I need the toilet.

551
00:47:08,279 --> 00:47:10,029
What do you mean, the toilet?

552
00:47:10,613 --> 00:47:11,988
I've gotta shit.

553
00:47:12,613 --> 00:47:14,071
What the fuck you doing?

554
00:47:14,154 --> 00:47:17,529
- Roy, God! You're not taking a shit here.
- No, no.

555
00:47:17,613 --> 00:47:21,279
You're not taking a shit here! You're
not dropping a deuce in this attic.

556
00:47:22,071 --> 00:47:22,904
Fuck!

557
00:47:22,988 --> 00:47:25,321
- You better not.
- I'm not shitting in my pants!

558
00:47:26,613 --> 00:47:28,904
- No, no!
- Pull up your pants!

559
00:47:30,071 --> 00:47:31,446
I must preserve my dignity.

560
00:47:49,904 --> 00:47:51,279
Fuck you, Roy.

561
00:47:51,988 --> 00:47:53,529
Dignity?

562
00:48:04,738 --> 00:48:05,779
Oh, fuck.

563
00:48:07,529 --> 00:48:08,946
[sighing[.

564
00:48:11,404 --> 00:48:12,404
Fuck.

565
00:48:14,696 --> 00:48:16,863
Yeah... We're stuck
here for a while.

566
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:20,904
Good God, what a stench.

567
00:48:32,113 --> 00:48:33,113
Dave.

568
00:48:37,113 --> 00:48:38,529
- Dave?
- What?

569
00:48:40,529 --> 00:48:43,988
We're just like that girl and
her family, who hid in the attic.

570
00:48:46,154 --> 00:48:48,654
Who wrote that book
you read in your cell.

571
00:48:50,613 --> 00:48:51,654
Anne Frank?

572
00:48:53,613 --> 00:48:57,279
We're hiding up here in the
attic just like rodents, you know?

573
00:48:58,029 --> 00:49:01,321
You missed the part where she sat
down and took a shit all over the floor.

574
00:49:01,404 --> 00:49:04,029
Can you be quiet? Shut up, okay?

575
00:49:16,863 --> 00:49:18,154
What happened?

576
00:49:22,571 --> 00:49:24,696
They're killing each other.

577
00:49:27,029 --> 00:49:28,363
Oh, my God.

578
00:49:30,488 --> 00:49:32,821
Sh, sh, sh! Shut the fuck up!

579
00:49:35,529 --> 00:49:37,321
Oh, shut the fuck up!

580
00:50:18,321 --> 00:50:19,321
What's, uh...

581
00:50:21,654 --> 00:50:23,654
What's... what's happening?

582
00:50:25,279 --> 00:50:26,446
You know, this is steak!

583
00:50:33,738 --> 00:50:35,154
Hey, you're that lady, right?

584
00:50:36,529 --> 00:50:37,904
From that commercial?

585
00:50:38,738 --> 00:50:40,946
The one for the people
whose cocks aren't working?

586
00:50:42,821 --> 00:50:44,154
It's you, right?

587
00:50:47,404 --> 00:50:48,529
I told you!

588
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:50,821
Shit.

589
00:50:51,404 --> 00:50:53,529
A star and all.

590
00:50:55,238 --> 00:50:56,738
No wonder the steak is good.

591
00:50:58,238 --> 00:50:59,738
What is it?

592
00:51:02,446 --> 00:51:03,446
Tenderloin?

593
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:09,404
Hmm. It's New... New...

594
00:51:11,196 --> 00:51:12,946
New York... New York strip.

595
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:15,821
Ooooh!

596
00:51:24,238 --> 00:51:27,113
Who are you? Wh...
what are you doing here?

597
00:51:28,446 --> 00:51:29,446
I'm Petter.

598
00:51:30,738 --> 00:51:31,738
That's Dave.

599
00:51:32,363 --> 00:51:33,988
And the lump of meat is Roy.

600
00:51:35,738 --> 00:51:37,196
You shot my anus.

601
00:51:41,279 --> 00:51:44,154
According to your driver's
licenses, you're Lars.

602
00:51:44,904 --> 00:51:46,404
And you're Lisa.

603
00:51:47,196 --> 00:51:50,363
Of course, we should stay out
of your private affairs, but, uh...

604
00:51:51,529 --> 00:51:54,821
it looks like you two hava a
little, uh... relationship problem.

605
00:51:58,404 --> 00:52:01,738
And, considering that guy
there, one of you's also a killer.

606
00:52:03,946 --> 00:52:05,196
It... it was him.

607
00:52:05,821 --> 00:52:07,904
- He's the one who killed him.
- You told me to.

608
00:52:07,988 --> 00:52:10,238
- That's not what I said.
- You shouted, "Stop him!"

609
00:52:10,321 --> 00:52:12,964
- I told you to stop the blood.
- You didn't say, "Stop the bleeding."

610
00:52:12,988 --> 00:52:15,279
- I'd have done it. You said, "Stop him."
- Yeah...

611
00:52:15,363 --> 00:52:17,047
- I meant stop the blood. What else...
- Okay...

612
00:52:17,071 --> 00:52:19,946
- What you meant... You didn't say!
- You're so fucking stupid.

613
00:52:20,029 --> 00:52:21,571
- You're the dumb...
- Okay!

614
00:52:23,488 --> 00:52:25,696
I don't give a fuck
about all that stuff.

615
00:52:28,363 --> 00:52:29,904
It's a kick, huh?

616
00:52:33,988 --> 00:52:35,613
Killin' a man in cold blood.

617
00:52:39,654 --> 00:52:41,654
You feel it, right? It's a rush.

618
00:52:42,238 --> 00:52:44,029
Ooooh.

619
00:52:46,821 --> 00:52:51,238
Me and the boys here have broken free
from state conservatorship, so to speak.

620
00:52:51,321 --> 00:52:54,821
We hiked two days through the
woods before we found your cabin.

621
00:52:54,904 --> 00:52:56,779
Thought we'd settle down here.

622
00:52:57,363 --> 00:52:59,654
Before you came barging in.

623
00:53:01,154 --> 00:53:02,904
Do you have any
idea what it's like

624
00:53:02,988 --> 00:53:05,696
to be stuck in that shallow
fucking attic of yours

625
00:53:05,779 --> 00:53:10,196
for 24 hours, smelling
nothing but Nazi mess?

626
00:53:13,238 --> 00:53:15,488
- Um...
- Okay. Come on, Petter. Enough talk.

627
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:21,238
So, our next order
of business is cash.

628
00:53:21,321 --> 00:53:24,029
We have a... Well,
a liquidity problem,

629
00:53:24,113 --> 00:53:25,779
I guess you could say.

630
00:53:25,863 --> 00:53:28,363
We've searched through
all your wallets and pockets

631
00:53:28,446 --> 00:53:29,696
and the luggage upstairs.

632
00:53:29,779 --> 00:53:31,696
From that, we put
together a few hundred.

633
00:53:31,779 --> 00:53:34,738
And we found a thousand in
the pockets of that dead guy,

634
00:53:34,821 --> 00:53:36,613
so thanks for that one, Lars!

635
00:53:40,654 --> 00:53:45,113
We have, uh... There's
2,000 kroner in the office.

636
00:53:45,779 --> 00:53:48,363
In a ceramic bowl on the desk.

637
00:53:49,738 --> 00:53:50,738
Take it.

638
00:53:52,488 --> 00:53:54,321
Please, just leave us alone.

639
00:53:56,529 --> 00:53:57,529
Please.

640
00:53:59,196 --> 00:54:00,196
Thank you, Lisa.

641
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:01,863
That's kind.

642
00:54:01,946 --> 00:54:04,279
Fuck! Enough talking.

643
00:54:08,196 --> 00:54:10,363
What? Oh, my God!

644
00:54:10,446 --> 00:54:13,113
Like I said, we've been
in prison for a while, and...

645
00:54:14,279 --> 00:54:16,404
you probably know
that men have...

646
00:54:16,488 --> 00:54:18,196
...natural needs.

647
00:54:19,404 --> 00:54:21,238
Please. I beg you.

648
00:54:21,321 --> 00:54:22,321
I'm begging you.

649
00:54:22,404 --> 00:54:24,696
I'll do anything.
I'm begging you.

650
00:54:24,779 --> 00:54:26,863
Anything you want,
but just not that.

651
00:54:26,946 --> 00:54:29,946
You know, the balls get
fuller and fuller over the years.

652
00:54:32,738 --> 00:54:36,279
They must be emptied. The
gonads must be drained...

653
00:54:36,363 --> 00:54:38,696
...before it goes to the brain,

654
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:40,071
before it curdles.

655
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:43,321
Okay?

656
00:54:45,279 --> 00:54:46,863
Let's see if you're
satisfied now.

657
00:54:51,029 --> 00:54:52,863
Shit.

658
00:54:54,488 --> 00:54:56,738
You're an ice-cold
motherfucker, Lars.

659
00:55:04,654 --> 00:55:05,654
Okay.

660
00:55:06,404 --> 00:55:08,154
Go on, then, Queer Dave.

661
00:55:11,321 --> 00:55:13,029
- No, no!
- Come and help!

662
00:55:13,113 --> 00:55:15,154
No! No, no!

663
00:55:15,238 --> 00:55:17,154
No, no, no, no! Help!

664
00:55:18,321 --> 00:55:19,654
No!

665
00:55:20,404 --> 00:55:22,071
No! Let me go!

666
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:26,988
No!

667
00:55:27,071 --> 00:55:28,113
No! No!

668
00:55:29,404 --> 00:55:30,821
No!

669
00:55:39,946 --> 00:55:41,029
No, please!

670
00:55:41,113 --> 00:55:43,321
Ah, no! No! I...

671
00:55:43,904 --> 00:55:44,904
No!

672
00:55:48,321 --> 00:55:50,238
Hey. Hold on.

673
00:55:50,321 --> 00:55:52,404
- Want a little tip, Lisa?
- No!

674
00:55:52,488 --> 00:55:53,904
No!

675
00:55:53,988 --> 00:55:55,279
Just relax.

676
00:55:57,446 --> 00:55:58,613
If you fight it...

677
00:56:01,446 --> 00:56:03,571
- oh, a lot more pain.
- No!

678
00:56:04,613 --> 00:56:06,029
No!

679
00:56:07,321 --> 00:56:09,071
No!

680
00:56:09,154 --> 00:56:10,779
- No!
- Hey, hey.

681
00:56:16,529 --> 00:56:18,529
- He's like a fish.
- Oh, God! Please!

682
00:56:20,488 --> 00:56:22,029
Please.

683
00:56:23,404 --> 00:56:26,529
Please. Please. I don't...

684
00:56:27,113 --> 00:56:29,238
I haven't done anything.

685
00:56:29,321 --> 00:56:30,654
Please.

686
00:56:30,738 --> 00:56:33,238
I've seen a lot of men
beg in my life. Lars.

687
00:56:35,154 --> 00:56:38,321
You're gonna have to do a lot
better than that if you want a chance.

688
00:56:38,404 --> 00:56:40,904
I mean, don't you
know who this is?

689
00:56:42,738 --> 00:56:44,946
This is Dave
"Horse Dick" Eriksen.

690
00:56:46,821 --> 00:56:49,529
I'll be honest, Lars. It's gonna
feel like two bodybuilders

691
00:56:49,613 --> 00:56:51,738
are shoving a fire
hydrant up there.

692
00:56:51,821 --> 00:56:54,363
I beg you.

693
00:56:55,488 --> 00:56:57,238
Really, really...

694
00:57:02,071 --> 00:57:03,321
Please...

695
00:57:03,404 --> 00:57:05,071
Look... look...

696
00:57:05,613 --> 00:57:06,654
look...

697
00:57:07,238 --> 00:57:09,196
Please. Enough.

698
00:57:09,279 --> 00:57:11,154
I'm afraid.

699
00:57:11,238 --> 00:57:12,404
I...

700
00:57:18,113 --> 00:57:20,696
- Please.
- I think we need to help you a little.

701
00:57:20,779 --> 00:57:22,321
Please, please, no.

702
00:57:25,113 --> 00:57:26,863
What... what...

703
00:57:28,071 --> 00:57:30,363
- No!
- What? What...

704
00:57:32,738 --> 00:57:33,946
No. You...

705
00:57:34,029 --> 00:57:37,904
You can take everything I
have! Don't use that on me.

706
00:57:37,988 --> 00:57:40,029
Don't. No, no,
no, please. Don't.

707
00:57:40,113 --> 00:57:41,238
Don't do it.

708
00:57:41,321 --> 00:57:42,988
- Don't...
- Come on, Lars.

709
00:57:43,071 --> 00:57:44,946
If you really sell this now...

710
00:57:45,904 --> 00:57:48,488
- Yeah?
- ...we might not let Dave loose on you.

711
00:57:51,321 --> 00:57:53,279
Oh, God! Please!

712
00:57:54,446 --> 00:57:57,154
- I don't want to, please! No!
- Lars.

713
00:57:57,238 --> 00:58:00,113
Calm down. Lars, Lars, Lars...

714
00:58:00,196 --> 00:58:02,613
- Calm down.
- Oh, God Oh!

715
00:58:02,696 --> 00:58:04,613
- Fuck...
- Sh...

716
00:58:04,696 --> 00:58:06,821
Focus, now. Focus.

717
00:58:06,904 --> 00:58:08,571
Hey, wait a minute, Petter.

718
00:58:08,654 --> 00:58:09,821
- I'm not done yet.
- Shh.

719
00:58:40,863 --> 00:58:42,321
Oh, fuck!

720
00:58:42,821 --> 00:58:44,863
That was intense.

721
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:54,988
Lars.

722
00:58:56,279 --> 00:58:57,821
You're not done yet, you know.

723
00:58:59,779 --> 00:59:01,738
You should kiss my
feet. Kiss my feet.

724
00:59:03,279 --> 00:59:05,196
Come on. Kiss my feet, Lars.

725
00:59:07,946 --> 00:59:09,029
Kiss...

726
00:59:10,196 --> 00:59:12,279
Come, come. Come now.

727
00:59:13,738 --> 00:59:15,321
Come here. Yeah, come here.

728
00:59:20,404 --> 00:59:21,404
Come on.

729
00:59:22,696 --> 00:59:23,738
No.

730
00:59:24,529 --> 00:59:25,571
Use some tongue.

731
00:59:26,904 --> 00:59:28,696
Use some tongue, Lars. Come on.

732
00:59:41,696 --> 00:59:43,863
There you go. Yeah.

733
00:59:45,154 --> 00:59:47,321
That's a good boy, Lars.

734
00:59:49,904 --> 00:59:51,279
That's a good boy.

735
00:59:56,071 --> 00:59:58,321
Now, look up at your
wife. Look at Lisa.

736
01:00:02,863 --> 01:00:05,113
And tell her that
you're a little shit.

737
01:00:06,238 --> 01:00:08,404
Come on, Lars. Say it.

738
01:00:08,488 --> 01:00:11,821
Tell her you're a little shit.

739
01:00:11,904 --> 01:00:14,196
Come on, Lars. Tell her.

740
01:00:14,279 --> 01:00:15,279
I'm a...

741
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:17,404
Louder, Lars.

742
01:00:18,488 --> 01:00:19,863
Louder!

743
01:00:19,946 --> 01:00:21,821
I'm a little shit!

744
01:00:23,821 --> 01:00:25,404
- Isn't he?
- I'm...

745
01:00:25,488 --> 01:00:27,988
I'm a little shit. I'm...

746
01:00:30,654 --> 01:00:33,613
Yeah, this is starting
to look all right.

747
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:35,576
What do you say, Dave?

748
01:00:35,613 --> 01:00:39,029
Ehhh... it's a little
amateurish to me.

749
01:00:41,238 --> 01:00:42,863
- Yeah, you think so?
- Mm-hm.

750
01:00:42,946 --> 01:00:43,946
All right.

751
01:00:46,238 --> 01:00:48,613
Yeah. It looks like you're
gettin' fucked anyway, Lars.

752
01:00:48,696 --> 01:00:51,404
- No!
- Roy!

753
01:00:51,488 --> 01:00:53,113
No, I don't want to! No!

754
01:00:53,904 --> 01:00:55,321
No! No!

755
01:00:55,404 --> 01:00:57,113
No, no! No! No!

756
01:01:02,988 --> 01:01:04,863
Oh, no! No!

757
01:01:07,654 --> 01:01:10,113
Wait! Stop, stop! Stop!

758
01:01:10,863 --> 01:01:12,654
Stop. Stop! Stop it.

759
01:01:13,446 --> 01:01:14,446
I have...

760
01:01:15,738 --> 01:01:17,029
a lot of money.

761
01:01:18,529 --> 01:01:20,154
A large amount of money...

762
01:01:21,613 --> 01:01:24,613
in the bank in the city
that I... that I put away.

763
01:01:29,154 --> 01:01:30,529
125,000.

764
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:33,863
We can go there tomorrow,
when the bank opens.

765
01:01:34,363 --> 01:01:36,083
I'll take everything
out and give it to you.

766
01:01:38,738 --> 01:01:40,113
Everything I have.

767
01:01:43,863 --> 01:01:45,743
But not if you do what
you were gonna do to him.

768
01:01:50,654 --> 01:01:51,779
Or to me.

769
01:01:53,613 --> 01:01:54,696
You follow?

770
01:02:10,363 --> 01:02:12,446
What about poor Roy over here?

771
01:02:13,071 --> 01:02:15,279
He was looking
forward to having a...

772
01:02:15,363 --> 01:02:18,571
short and stormy
relationship with you.

773
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:25,071
Of course, that kind of
money does help your case.

774
01:02:25,863 --> 01:02:27,488
It can keep us out of trouble.

775
01:02:39,363 --> 01:02:41,654
Okay, it's a deal.

776
01:02:41,738 --> 01:02:43,363
Ah, fuckin' A.

777
01:02:44,321 --> 01:02:45,321
No one touches him.

778
01:02:55,738 --> 01:02:57,029
All right, Lars.

779
01:02:58,363 --> 01:03:01,738
Looks like your wife
saved your ass. Literally.

780
01:04:01,988 --> 01:04:03,904
Hey, uh... Petter?

781
01:04:06,446 --> 01:04:07,946
How many people have you killed?

782
01:04:13,529 --> 01:04:14,529
Why do you ask?

783
01:04:14,613 --> 01:04:17,630
I'm just wondering how many people
you've really killed, because I've heard...

784
01:04:17,654 --> 01:04:19,363
- Ow! Fuck!
- Lie still!

785
01:04:20,488 --> 01:04:23,488
I just... I just heard you were
the worst bastard in there.

786
01:04:25,446 --> 01:04:27,279
And I heard that, um...

787
01:04:27,863 --> 01:04:29,613
Come on, now, what'd you hear?

788
01:04:29,696 --> 01:04:31,321
That you robbed that bank.

789
01:04:33,654 --> 01:04:36,321
And then you killed
your whole gang?

790
01:04:38,196 --> 01:04:39,196
All three.

791
01:04:40,571 --> 01:04:43,154
Because you didn't wanna
split the money, they said.

792
01:04:44,446 --> 01:04:46,946
So that's what you heard?

793
01:04:48,363 --> 01:04:50,321
Yeah...

794
01:04:51,196 --> 01:04:54,363
The headline's correct, but
the details are bullshit, obviously.

795
01:04:58,113 --> 01:04:59,279
What does that mean?

796
01:05:03,529 --> 01:05:06,154
I got rid of those
guys, but it, uh...

797
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:09,029
wasn't for the cash.

798
01:05:10,446 --> 01:05:12,321
I'm not a greedy boy, Roy.

799
01:05:14,238 --> 01:05:15,529
Then...

800
01:05:16,196 --> 01:05:17,946
Why did you kill them, then?

801
01:05:18,446 --> 01:05:19,946
They had no value.

802
01:05:21,404 --> 01:05:24,863
Look at you, for example,
right? You're here because...

803
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:28,821
your brother knew that
guy at the security company.

804
01:05:30,446 --> 01:05:33,696
In our little escape plan,
that obviously had... value.

805
01:05:35,904 --> 01:05:36,904
But, uh...

806
01:05:40,363 --> 01:05:41,779
Do I have value now?

807
01:05:42,779 --> 01:05:43,988
Ow! Fff...

808
01:05:44,071 --> 01:05:45,279
Good as new.

809
01:05:46,946 --> 01:05:48,988
And now you have value again.

810
01:06:03,779 --> 01:06:04,779
Lars?

811
01:06:10,404 --> 01:06:11,404
Lars?

812
01:06:13,363 --> 01:06:14,571
Lars, can you hear me?

813
01:06:20,446 --> 01:06:22,363
How the hell did we get here?

814
01:06:27,863 --> 01:06:29,904
I don't just mean
here, I mean...

815
01:06:34,154 --> 01:06:36,696
I was so in love with you.

816
01:06:39,738 --> 01:06:41,279
When we got together...

817
01:06:42,363 --> 01:06:44,904
I thought that we
would always be a team.

818
01:06:45,821 --> 01:06:47,154
You and me.

819
01:06:48,946 --> 01:06:51,571
I thought we would do all
that stuff we talked about.

820
01:06:53,821 --> 01:06:54,904
That I could...

821
01:06:59,321 --> 01:07:01,696
have such a
wonderful life with you.

822
01:07:04,696 --> 01:07:06,863
Then it's just...

823
01:07:07,529 --> 01:07:10,154
Then it's just debts
and arguments and...

824
01:07:10,988 --> 01:07:12,571
disappointing each other.

825
01:07:15,946 --> 01:07:17,946
And everything turns awful.

826
01:07:21,988 --> 01:07:22,988
And then...

827
01:07:25,696 --> 01:07:26,821
Diego.

828
01:07:37,904 --> 01:07:40,029
I'm so...

829
01:07:42,071 --> 01:07:43,988
I'm so sorry for that.

830
01:07:46,071 --> 01:07:48,654
It didn't mean anything.

831
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:56,529
Hey...

832
01:07:57,738 --> 01:07:59,821
It really meant nothing.

833
01:08:09,863 --> 01:08:11,196
Fuck it. Just forget it.

834
01:08:14,238 --> 01:08:15,654
It doesn't matter, anyway.

835
01:08:16,571 --> 01:08:17,988
We'll both be dead soon.

836
01:08:24,863 --> 01:08:28,779
Can you name for me some of
Parliament's most important tasks?

837
01:08:29,363 --> 01:08:32,279
Pass laws, pass the state budget
and watch over the government.

838
01:08:32,363 --> 01:08:33,613
Tell us.

839
01:08:33,696 --> 01:08:36,904
- Go ahead and tell us the answer.
- Pass laws. Pass the state budget.

840
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:38,113
And control the government.

841
01:08:40,154 --> 01:08:42,029
You almost said it earlier.

842
01:08:42,113 --> 01:08:44,113
- Yeah.
- What's the budget called

843
01:08:44,196 --> 01:08:46,321
that estimates the
state's income and bills?

844
01:08:46,404 --> 01:08:48,084
- The state budget.
- State budget.

845
01:08:48,113 --> 01:08:49,529
Exactly right.

846
01:08:49,613 --> 01:08:51,821
Damn, you're smart.
You should be a professor.

847
01:08:53,404 --> 01:08:54,404
Professor?

848
01:08:56,154 --> 01:08:59,446
I could have been prime
minister, if born in the right zip code.

849
01:09:21,029 --> 01:09:22,363
Hello?

850
01:09:22,446 --> 01:09:23,904
Next question is...

851
01:09:25,238 --> 01:09:26,279
Sh.

852
01:09:27,196 --> 01:09:28,863
Somebody!

853
01:09:29,738 --> 01:09:31,029
Hello?

854
01:09:32,321 --> 01:09:35,904
- Lars... What are you doing?
- Can someone come down?

855
01:09:35,988 --> 01:09:37,779
Lars! Shut up!
What are you doing?

856
01:09:37,863 --> 01:09:40,613
- Can someone come down here?
- Lars! Shut up! Shut up!

857
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:43,238
Lars!

858
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:45,529
What are you doing?

859
01:09:46,279 --> 01:09:47,279
Lars!

860
01:09:47,821 --> 01:09:48,821
Lars!

861
01:09:49,571 --> 01:09:50,488
Lars.

862
01:09:50,571 --> 01:09:52,488
What the fuck are you doing?

863
01:09:52,571 --> 01:09:54,571
Roy. Go on down.

864
01:09:57,821 --> 01:10:00,446
Please come down! Come down now!

865
01:10:07,613 --> 01:10:08,904
I need the toilet.

866
01:10:09,613 --> 01:10:11,196
Piss your pants.

867
01:10:11,279 --> 01:10:14,446
Um... It's, um... a number two.

868
01:10:18,988 --> 01:10:20,446
The guy's gotta take a shit!

869
01:10:22,154 --> 01:10:23,529
So let him take a shit.

870
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:36,363
You're not gonna
do something, right?

871
01:10:36,446 --> 01:10:37,446
- No.
- No.

872
01:10:54,154 --> 01:10:55,154
Hey, wait.

873
01:10:56,529 --> 01:11:00,613
I'm just gonna see if you
have anything you might...

874
01:11:01,613 --> 01:11:03,696
surprise little Roy with.

875
01:11:32,279 --> 01:11:35,529
You know what... you
know what this means?

876
01:11:37,404 --> 01:11:38,404
Look!

877
01:11:41,696 --> 01:11:43,863
It means I don't
like folks like you.

878
01:11:46,071 --> 01:11:47,529
- Okay.
- Hm.

879
01:11:48,654 --> 01:11:50,113
Just give us that money.

880
01:11:53,946 --> 01:11:56,279
The money is why Petter
says I can't molest you.

881
01:11:57,863 --> 01:11:59,488
- Yeah, exactly.
- Mm-hm.

882
01:12:02,529 --> 01:12:05,279
But I was thinking...

883
01:12:07,654 --> 01:12:10,113
if you can just show
your boobies to me, then...

884
01:12:12,738 --> 01:12:14,029
You know, titties...

885
01:12:16,529 --> 01:12:18,113
Then I can jerk it a little.

886
01:12:21,571 --> 01:12:23,613
Mm... I don't know/.

887
01:12:26,654 --> 01:12:28,071
I don't...

888
01:12:28,154 --> 01:12:29,154
think so.

889
01:12:34,196 --> 01:12:35,904
I'll talk to Petter about it.

890
01:12:38,071 --> 01:12:40,696
Yeah. I'll talk to
Petter about it.

891
01:12:53,321 --> 01:12:54,363
Lars!

892
01:13:04,988 --> 01:13:06,196
Can you untie me?

893
01:13:07,404 --> 01:13:08,404
Lars!

894
01:13:10,196 --> 01:13:11,238
Lars!

895
01:13:13,363 --> 01:13:15,571
Lars! Lars!

896
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:50,571
Come back, dear!

897
01:13:50,654 --> 01:13:52,654
Roy! How's it going down there?

898
01:13:57,946 --> 01:13:59,446
Roy! What's the deal?

899
01:14:02,029 --> 01:14:04,529
Fuck. He's as
deaf as he is stupid.

900
01:14:12,988 --> 01:14:14,696
...all the way to the final...

901
01:14:16,529 --> 01:14:17,571
Roy!

902
01:14:17,654 --> 01:14:19,988
All right, baby! Are you...

903
01:14:21,446 --> 01:14:23,404
Fuck's sake.

904
01:14:27,779 --> 01:14:29,404
Roy! What the fuck's going on?

905
01:14:38,154 --> 01:14:39,154
Roy!

906
01:14:40,029 --> 01:14:41,029
Roy!

907
01:14:41,571 --> 01:14:42,946
Roy?

908
01:14:47,071 --> 01:14:49,154
What happened?

909
01:14:51,196 --> 01:14:52,196
He hit me with a...

910
01:14:56,863 --> 01:14:58,988
- He hit me with his sock.
- Sock?

911
01:15:04,446 --> 01:15:05,529
Fuck.

912
01:15:07,613 --> 01:15:08,821
Fuck!

913
01:15:09,654 --> 01:15:11,196
They can't have gotten far.

914
01:15:12,238 --> 01:15:13,238
Come on, then.

915
01:15:27,238 --> 01:15:29,279
Okay. Roy, take the road.

916
01:15:29,363 --> 01:15:31,321
Dave, with me.

917
01:16:05,863 --> 01:16:06,904
Damn!

918
01:16:16,779 --> 01:16:19,196
Fuck...

919
01:16:25,904 --> 01:16:26,946
Come on, come on!

920
01:16:27,863 --> 01:16:28,863
Fuck!

921
01:16:29,654 --> 01:16:30,529
A-ha!

922
01:16:30,613 --> 01:16:32,071
- Bingo!
- What you got there?

923
01:16:38,279 --> 01:16:39,279
Nothing.

924
01:16:40,488 --> 01:16:41,488
Give it here.

925
01:16:43,446 --> 01:16:44,488
Come here.

926
01:16:46,988 --> 01:16:48,029
Come here.

927
01:16:54,154 --> 01:16:55,154
Boat keys.

928
01:16:56,446 --> 01:16:57,446
That's smart.

929
01:16:57,529 --> 01:17:00,529
You would have made it too,
if my flashlight hadn't broke.

930
01:17:03,071 --> 01:17:06,029
You... still need me alive.

931
01:17:07,988 --> 01:17:10,654
- For the cash.
- The money doesn't matter now.

932
01:17:12,946 --> 01:17:14,404
Your man hit me in the head.

933
01:17:15,529 --> 01:17:17,363
So the rules say
you've gotta die.

934
01:17:17,946 --> 01:17:20,154
What fucking rules, huh? Huh?

935
01:17:20,738 --> 01:17:23,113
Hey... Wait, wait,
wait. Please, I beg you!

936
01:17:23,696 --> 01:17:26,404
Do you know how many
whores I've heard tell me that?

937
01:17:30,654 --> 01:17:34,863
Move away from the fridge. I don't want
to shoot it of there's still beer inside.

938
01:17:41,946 --> 01:17:42,946
So, I've...

939
01:17:43,738 --> 01:17:45,113
I thought some more.

940
01:17:45,946 --> 01:17:47,946
About what you
said in the basement.

941
01:17:48,029 --> 01:17:49,988
That you wanna take off my top.

942
01:17:51,738 --> 01:17:52,738
To see your tits.

943
01:17:53,654 --> 01:17:54,654
Yeah.

944
01:17:55,488 --> 01:17:56,821
Uh... Roy.

945
01:17:57,821 --> 01:18:00,321
It was Roy, right? I mean...

946
01:18:01,363 --> 01:18:04,071
I couldn't say it down
there, near the others, but...

947
01:18:04,738 --> 01:18:07,279
I mean, especially not in
front of my husband, but...

948
01:18:08,279 --> 01:18:09,529
I think I want you, too.

949
01:18:11,196 --> 01:18:13,154
I was thinking that I might...

950
01:18:13,821 --> 01:18:16,363
come with you after
we go to the bank.

951
01:18:16,863 --> 01:18:19,821
I could be, uh... with you.

952
01:18:19,904 --> 01:18:22,238
I know we don't know
each other that well, but...

953
01:18:22,988 --> 01:18:25,321
I think that the
two of us could...

954
01:18:26,613 --> 01:18:30,404
I think that on the road, we
could have... fun together.

955
01:18:31,196 --> 01:18:35,071
I mean, a lot of fun. If
you get what I'm saying.

956
01:18:39,696 --> 01:18:43,779
- I don't know if I know what...
- Oh, I think you understand.

957
01:18:44,488 --> 01:18:46,363
I see it in your eyes.

958
01:18:47,029 --> 01:18:48,571
I can see that you want to.

959
01:18:48,654 --> 01:18:50,654
- But...
- What? But what?

960
01:18:51,279 --> 01:18:53,696
- But you're a, uh...
- What am I?

961
01:18:54,404 --> 01:18:55,779
What am I, Roy?

962
01:19:00,488 --> 01:19:02,154
You're a Jew...

963
01:19:18,946 --> 01:19:20,613
No!

964
01:19:20,696 --> 01:19:22,613
Come on, stop!

965
01:19:58,071 --> 01:20:00,196
Fucking...

966
01:20:39,738 --> 01:20:40,738
Lisa!

967
01:20:41,821 --> 01:20:42,821
Lisa!

968
01:20:44,363 --> 01:20:45,571
Lisa!

969
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:36,279
No.

970
01:21:37,738 --> 01:21:39,029
No, no, no, no.

971
01:21:45,488 --> 01:21:46,488
Why?

972
01:21:48,154 --> 01:21:49,696
Why did this have to happen?

973
01:21:52,029 --> 01:21:54,529
What the hell did Roy
ever do to anyone, huh?

974
01:22:02,238 --> 01:22:05,071
Lars. Lars! Come here. Here!

975
01:22:12,321 --> 01:22:13,321
Come on.

976
01:22:14,529 --> 01:22:15,654
Come on.

977
01:22:47,404 --> 01:22:49,279
I know how we
ended up like this.

978
01:22:50,696 --> 01:22:52,279
It wasn't your fault.

979
01:22:53,696 --> 01:22:55,029
It's my fault.

980
01:22:55,696 --> 01:22:56,946
Only mine.

981
01:23:06,696 --> 01:23:10,904
When you tell me that...
that I gave up, you're right.

982
01:23:10,988 --> 01:23:12,071
I gave up.

983
01:23:12,904 --> 01:23:15,154
And I blamed
everyone else for it.

984
01:23:16,238 --> 01:23:20,029
You. Work. That fucking debt.

985
01:23:20,821 --> 01:23:24,613
Somehow, I became
okay with it all falling apart.

986
01:23:32,279 --> 01:23:33,279
I'm sorry.

987
01:23:34,988 --> 01:23:36,196
I'm sorry.

988
01:23:43,279 --> 01:23:45,279
- They're coming. They're coming.
- Sh,

989
01:23:45,363 --> 01:23:46,738
They're coming! Shhh!

990
01:24:03,488 --> 01:24:04,696
Take the boat.

991
01:24:05,238 --> 01:24:06,904
- What about you?
- I'll come after.

992
01:24:38,488 --> 01:24:39,488
Lisa.

993
01:24:40,613 --> 01:24:42,071
In the kitchen with Roy?

994
01:24:47,113 --> 01:24:49,696
That was the best goddam
performance I've ever seen.

995
01:25:15,238 --> 01:25:16,238
Fuck.

996
01:25:16,904 --> 01:25:19,529
Oh! Fuck!

997
01:25:25,488 --> 01:25:26,696
Come on, Lisa. Lisa!

998
01:25:49,404 --> 01:25:52,196
Just hold that
fucking whore for me.

999
01:26:02,154 --> 01:26:03,696
I just tried to be nice, Lars.

1000
01:26:04,529 --> 01:26:06,196
Keep on good terms.

1001
01:26:07,196 --> 01:26:09,404
Stupid, stupid me.

1002
01:26:09,488 --> 01:26:11,446
What...

1003
01:26:14,696 --> 01:26:16,904
You live and you
learn, you know, Lars.

1004
01:26:17,821 --> 01:26:19,488
- No! No!
- Stay still. Stay still.

1005
01:26:19,571 --> 01:26:24,071
And you're gonna see what happens
when you mess with Petter Larsen!

1006
01:26:28,196 --> 01:26:30,946
I've killed people many
different ways, Lars.

1007
01:26:34,404 --> 01:26:35,946
Oh, fuck!

1008
01:26:38,321 --> 01:26:40,196
I've shot them,
strangled them and...

1009
01:26:40,279 --> 01:26:41,279
No, no!

1010
01:26:41,363 --> 01:26:44,779
...I've burnt them, I've stabbed
them, I've beaten them to a pulp...

1011
01:26:44,863 --> 01:26:46,738
Stop! No!

1012
01:26:46,821 --> 01:26:48,071
- Oh, God!
- In '92,

1013
01:26:48,654 --> 01:26:50,863
I cut a man's head
off with a bottle opener.

1014
01:26:52,529 --> 01:26:56,238
But I have never put someone's
head into a lawn mower.

1015
01:26:56,946 --> 01:26:58,154
So thanks for that!

1016
01:26:59,988 --> 01:27:02,071
Oh! Oh, my God!

1017
01:27:05,196 --> 01:27:07,154
Let him go! Let him go!

1018
01:27:36,029 --> 01:27:39,238
What in the halls of hell
are you doing out here?

1019
01:27:40,321 --> 01:27:44,446
SIX HOURS EARLIER

1020
01:28:43,446 --> 01:28:46,446
Oh, for the love of God,
what the fuck do you...

1021
01:28:51,321 --> 01:28:53,738
- Hello?
- Hello.

1022
01:28:54,529 --> 01:28:57,863
Hello, yeah. It's Hans.
Hans out by the fjord.

1023
01:28:57,946 --> 01:28:59,071
Hans?

1024
01:28:59,613 --> 01:29:02,529
I'm sorry for calling a
strapping young man like you

1025
01:29:02,613 --> 01:29:03,988
so late this evening.

1026
01:29:04,488 --> 01:29:10,696
But I was out driving my car, you
see. I was going to, uh... the pharmacy.

1027
01:29:10,779 --> 01:29:13,988
You know, I need my medicine,
and I wasn't sure I had any at home,

1028
01:29:14,071 --> 01:29:15,654
but anyway, there it was.

1029
01:29:17,071 --> 01:29:19,488
Sometimes, the pharmacy's
open late these days.

1030
01:29:19,571 --> 01:29:22,071
So I thought I oughta
get some more,

1031
01:29:22,154 --> 01:29:24,821
in case I was all out of
the stuff I have at home.

1032
01:29:24,904 --> 01:29:27,154
And so, I got some
more, but then I got home

1033
01:29:27,238 --> 01:29:30,363
and saw that I already had some
here, anyway, so that, you know...

1034
01:29:30,446 --> 01:29:32,404
- That... Well, that's all.
- Hans, Hans!

1035
01:29:32,488 --> 01:29:34,238
Hans, why are you
calling my cellphone

1036
01:29:34,321 --> 01:29:36,279
in the middle of the
goddamn fuckin' night?

1037
01:29:36,363 --> 01:29:37,988
Well, uh, like I said...

1038
01:29:38,071 --> 01:29:39,630
...I drove past your cabin.

1039
01:29:39,654 --> 01:29:41,029
Did I mention that?

1040
01:29:41,113 --> 01:29:43,404
Uh, and the light was on...

1041
01:29:43,488 --> 01:29:47,029
- It was on in the house.
- That's because my son is there.

1042
01:29:47,529 --> 01:29:51,654
And there were a lot of cars
parked all around the front.

1043
01:29:52,154 --> 01:29:55,571
On the outside. Also, also
the main door was wide open...

1044
01:29:55,654 --> 01:29:59,404
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Uh... Did you go check on him?

1045
01:29:59,988 --> 01:30:02,154
No, because you never know!

1046
01:30:02,238 --> 01:30:04,071
It could be a break-in
or something...

1047
01:30:04,154 --> 01:30:07,196
- Something dangerous.
- Yeah. Uh, Hans, Hans, that's great.

1048
01:30:07,279 --> 01:30:10,446
Thank you for giving me
this call, okay? Good night.

1049
01:30:11,154 --> 01:30:13,863
Yeah. No problem
at all. Good night.

1050
01:30:22,529 --> 01:30:25,446
Hi, this is Lars. I'm probably
on set, so leave a message,

1051
01:30:25,529 --> 01:30:27,409
and I'll get back
to you after we...

1052
01:30:38,613 --> 01:30:41,029
Goddamn piece
of shit old man legs!

1053
01:30:45,863 --> 01:30:48,113
Ahmed, my dear friend.

1054
01:30:49,029 --> 01:30:50,613
So, I've got a little problem.

1055
01:30:51,404 --> 01:30:54,738
- You know my house by the lake.
- Mikkel, get back to bed.

1056
01:30:54,821 --> 01:30:56,738
- And you know my name is Abid.
- Listen.

1057
01:30:56,821 --> 01:30:59,904
They're breaking windows
down there. His phone is off.

1058
01:30:59,988 --> 01:31:03,488
- I've got to go to my...
- To your bed. We can talk about it later.

1059
01:31:03,571 --> 01:31:05,321
Take that bed and
shove it up your ass!

1060
01:31:05,404 --> 01:31:07,529
- I don't have time for this!
- Okay. That's enough.

1061
01:31:17,529 --> 01:31:19,863
A goddamn homo-mobile.

1062
01:31:52,196 --> 01:31:54,154
Hey. Fatty!

1063
01:31:56,779 --> 01:32:00,363
Fuckin' long-haired,
Green-votin', draft-dodgin',

1064
01:32:00,446 --> 01:32:02,696
grass-smokin', tree-fuckin'...

1065
01:32:03,696 --> 01:32:05,279
What in the fuck...

1066
01:32:05,363 --> 01:32:06,654
Fuck!

1067
01:32:14,238 --> 01:32:15,529
Mikkel!

1068
01:32:15,613 --> 01:32:16,904
Papa?

1069
01:32:19,946 --> 01:32:22,529
My cabin! Fuck...

1070
01:32:24,988 --> 01:32:26,654
Hey! Don't come closer.

1071
01:32:27,613 --> 01:32:29,404
One more step, and I'll cut.

1072
01:32:30,571 --> 01:32:32,154
You're feelin' tough for...

1073
01:32:33,779 --> 01:32:35,279
a guy with no gun.

1074
01:32:38,488 --> 01:32:40,988
Cut that, you little fucker.

1075
01:32:41,071 --> 01:32:42,488
Papa!

1076
01:32:51,738 --> 01:32:54,654
You're gonna watch
me while I kill your son

1077
01:32:54,738 --> 01:32:56,988
and fuck your daughter-in-law
while you bleed.

1078
01:33:01,904 --> 01:33:02,988
Papa!

1079
01:33:05,404 --> 01:33:07,279
- Papa, no!
- Get in the car!

1080
01:33:07,363 --> 01:33:09,154
Oh, my nose...

1081
01:33:09,988 --> 01:33:11,446
What nose?

1082
01:33:41,154 --> 01:33:42,154
Fuck!

1083
01:33:47,363 --> 01:33:49,571
It's fucked.

1084
01:33:49,654 --> 01:33:51,071
They fucked it.

1085
01:33:58,571 --> 01:34:00,488
- Lisa?
- Hm?

1086
01:34:02,613 --> 01:34:04,946
Get down to the
boat and get it ready.

1087
01:34:07,071 --> 01:34:08,071
What?

1088
01:34:09,238 --> 01:34:11,613
- Don't go back.
- There's somethin' I gotta do.

1089
01:34:11,696 --> 01:34:12,738
No. Mm.

1090
01:34:13,238 --> 01:34:14,238
I have to.

1091
01:34:14,779 --> 01:34:16,196
Hey. Stop whining.

1092
01:34:16,279 --> 01:34:18,321
Hey. Look at me.
I said, look at me!

1093
01:34:18,404 --> 01:34:19,738
Look at me.

1094
01:34:20,446 --> 01:34:22,696
Go inside, and
bandage that wound.

1095
01:34:23,821 --> 01:34:24,821
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1096
01:34:24,863 --> 01:34:25,863
I'll take care of them.

1097
01:34:25,946 --> 01:34:27,071
Okay?

1098
01:34:31,946 --> 01:34:33,696
Fucker!

1099
01:34:50,779 --> 01:34:52,363
Okay. Come on.

1100
01:34:52,863 --> 01:34:54,863
Come on. Oh, come on.

1101
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:56,904
Come on, yeah.

1102
01:35:09,988 --> 01:35:11,029
Damn it.

1103
01:35:14,238 --> 01:35:16,988
Fuck, fuck, fuck! Come on!

1104
01:35:19,946 --> 01:35:20,946
Fuck.

1105
01:36:17,613 --> 01:36:19,613
No more pain.

1106
01:36:20,196 --> 01:36:21,988
No more pain.

1107
01:36:31,946 --> 01:36:33,196
Okay...

1108
01:36:41,738 --> 01:36:42,738
Going fishing?

1109
01:36:47,238 --> 01:36:48,571
[growls.

1110
01:37:05,988 --> 01:37:07,404
No gun in a nursing home.

1111
01:37:13,488 --> 01:37:15,238
What do you want from me?

1112
01:37:15,821 --> 01:37:17,779
Why not just take the
boat and get away?

1113
01:37:18,279 --> 01:37:20,821
Because, you
fucking Swedish cunt...

1114
01:37:21,863 --> 01:37:23,363
I still need that money.

1115
01:37:25,654 --> 01:37:27,238
You're getting it for me.

1116
01:37:29,363 --> 01:37:30,446
Okay, okay.

1117
01:37:33,529 --> 01:37:36,404
Listen, I got people who
owe me money. Big time.

1118
01:37:45,779 --> 01:37:47,154
Don't do it, please.

1119
01:37:49,654 --> 01:37:50,904
Please.

1120
01:37:55,571 --> 01:37:57,738
No. Oh, please. No, not my dick.

1121
01:37:58,696 --> 01:38:00,654
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1122
01:38:05,779 --> 01:38:08,196
Dave "Horse Dick"
Eriksen, was it?

1123
01:38:09,321 --> 01:38:12,363
I didn't mean it, okay? I
really wasn't gonna do it.

1124
01:38:13,071 --> 01:38:16,363
It was just... It
was all just a joke.

1125
01:38:16,446 --> 01:38:17,654
I swear.

1126
01:38:17,738 --> 01:38:19,113
That's a nice sweater.

1127
01:39:00,821 --> 01:39:01,821
Lars?

1128
01:39:03,738 --> 01:39:05,238
How are you?

1129
01:39:05,321 --> 01:39:06,696
How are you doing?

1130
01:39:06,779 --> 01:39:07,863
I'm good, Papa.

1131
01:39:09,238 --> 01:39:12,821
I just... just shotgunned
the guy in the balls, so...

1132
01:39:17,738 --> 01:39:18,821
I'm proud of you.

1133
01:39:21,071 --> 01:39:22,488
That's my boy.

1134
01:39:31,154 --> 01:39:32,154
You were right.

1135
01:39:32,238 --> 01:39:34,613
It is nicer to see
the sun rise than...

1136
01:39:35,946 --> 01:39:36,946
...see it set.

1137
01:40:26,488 --> 01:40:27,613
AdiÃ³s, Dave!

1138
01:40:42,363 --> 01:40:44,603
Are you really gonna leave
your partner behind like that?

1139
01:40:46,279 --> 01:40:48,738
There are no real
friends in my world, Lisa.

1140
01:40:49,904 --> 01:40:52,238
Either you have
value, or you don't.

1141
01:40:53,279 --> 01:40:56,071
And Dave definitely
has no value now.

1142
01:40:57,571 --> 01:40:59,738
Why are you so
preoccupied wirh Dave?

1143
01:41:01,238 --> 01:41:03,696
He was gonna make mincemeat
out of your husband's ass.

1144
01:41:10,446 --> 01:41:12,446
That scene down
in the basement...

1145
01:41:13,196 --> 01:41:17,696
Your husband laying there, begging like
a little girl and drooling on my shoes.

1146
01:41:18,779 --> 01:41:20,321
Where do you think he is now?

1147
01:41:20,404 --> 01:41:22,363
Hiding in the woods
like a little shit...

1148
01:41:48,738 --> 01:41:51,654
Come on, you fucker!

1149
01:42:28,738 --> 01:42:31,488
What the hell got you
thinking you can fucking fight?

1150
01:42:39,696 --> 01:42:41,404
AdiÃ³s, Petter.

1151
01:42:58,446 --> 01:43:01,363
What the fuck? That's the
stupidest shit I've ever seen!

1152
01:43:46,738 --> 01:43:48,779
And now you're
gonna fucking die,

1153
01:43:48,863 --> 01:43:51,738
you little good-for-nothin'
piece of shit rat.

1154
01:44:00,613 --> 01:44:03,154
Sorry, but you
have no value now.

1155
01:46:26,446 --> 01:46:27,904
Police are an hour out.

1156
01:46:36,321 --> 01:46:37,529
- Hey.
- Hmm?

1157
01:46:40,238 --> 01:46:42,238
When we were down
in that basement...

1158
01:46:44,821 --> 01:46:46,988
Those billiard
balls, how did you...

1159
01:47:06,529 --> 01:47:07,904
At least we're both alive.

1160
01:47:13,446 --> 01:47:16,696
We're still underwater,
just like before.

1161
01:47:18,363 --> 01:47:19,946
No money. Too much debt.

1162
01:47:22,988 --> 01:47:24,529
We're still fucked, Lisa.

1163
01:47:47,529 --> 01:47:50,238
- Huh. Yeah...
- Hmm?

1164
01:47:51,654 --> 01:47:53,071
How about, uh...

1165
01:48:04,446 --> 01:48:06,654
THREE HOURS AND
FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER

1166
01:48:35,696 --> 01:48:39,738
SURVIVED TERROR ON CABIN TRIP

1167
01:48:39,821 --> 01:48:43,654
FIVE DEAD IN CABIN MASSACRE

1168
01:48:43,738 --> 01:48:47,196
ESCAPED MURDERERS
KILLED BY MARRIED COUPLE

1169
01:48:49,821 --> 01:48:51,279
What can you tell us?

1170
01:49:01,488 --> 01:49:05,029
What do you think made it so
that the two of you survived?

1171
01:49:05,113 --> 01:49:08,363
I think... Well, I think that...

1172
01:49:09,446 --> 01:49:12,238
our love, and how strong it is

1173
01:49:13,113 --> 01:49:14,613
let us survive, yeah.

1174
01:49:17,446 --> 01:49:20,738
And now, your story is being
turned into a feature film.

1175
01:49:23,446 --> 01:49:25,779
Yeah, that's right.
It's gonna be a film.

1176
01:49:27,113 --> 01:49:30,113
BIDDING WAR FOR SCRIPT RIGHTS

1177
01:49:32,904 --> 01:49:36,571
STORY SOLD FOR MILLIONS

1178
01:49:38,654 --> 01:49:42,321
MAKING MOVIE WITH
HOLLYWOOD STARS

1179
01:49:50,446 --> 01:49:51,863
Yeah...

1180
01:49:53,071 --> 01:49:54,613
We're gonna have some fun now.

1181
01:49:56,488 --> 01:49:58,279
Hell, yeah, we are.

1182
01:50:08,654 --> 01:50:10,613
Aaah! Queer Dave.

1183
01:50:45,404 --> 01:50:47,363
Thank you so much, everybody.

1184
01:50:49,654 --> 01:50:51,779
That was exactly what happened.
