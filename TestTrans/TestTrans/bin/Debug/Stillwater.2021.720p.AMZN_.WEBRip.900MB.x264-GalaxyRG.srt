1
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:16,075
-

2
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,152
-

3
00:02:35,328 --> 00:02:37,025
: Thank you
for making my Sonic your Sonic.

4
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:38,940
My name is McKayla.
How can I help you tonight?

5
00:02:38,984 --> 00:02:41,900
I need a Footlong Cheese Coney
with mustard and onions,

6
00:02:41,943 --> 00:02:44,032
large Tots
and a large Cherry Limeade.

7
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:55,261
:
We're on the road showing

8
00:02:55,305 --> 00:02:58,786
real people the stain-fighting
power of OxiClean.

9
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:01,354
: Thank you, Lord, for
this and many other blessings.

10
00:03:01,398 --> 00:03:03,661
Please keep a watchful eye
over Ally.

11
00:03:03,704 --> 00:03:06,054
In Jesus' name. Amen.

12
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:07,839
: Do you
know how annoying that is?

13
00:03:07,882 --> 00:03:09,884
Not to mention you could
blow out your eye that way.

14
00:03:42,787 --> 00:03:44,745
-MAN: Where you from?
-BILL: Stillwater.

15
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:46,921
Who's the last drilling company
you worked for?

16
00:03:46,965 --> 00:03:50,011
-ITA.
-Why'd you quit?

17
00:03:50,055 --> 00:03:51,752
Operator dropped the rig.
We stacked.

18
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:53,754
I got laid off six months ago.

19
00:03:53,798 --> 00:03:54,799
What are you doing now?

20
00:03:54,842 --> 00:03:56,757
I work construction.

21
00:03:56,801 --> 00:04:00,108
But it's been slow
since the rig's been down.

22
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:03,242
I've been doing cleanup
after that tornado by Shawnee.

23
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:04,809
Getting after it.

24
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:16,995
Hey, Sharon.

25
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:19,084
Let me finish this page.

26
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:26,221
One more page.

27
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:29,355
Thank you for this food and for
all that is good in this world.

28
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,184
Keep Allison
in your watchful eye.

29
00:04:32,227 --> 00:04:34,273
-Amen.
-Amen.

30
00:04:36,362 --> 00:04:38,364
You get hired out yet?

31
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:42,977
Had an interview this morning.

32
00:04:45,153 --> 00:04:48,287
Got a call from your mother
a few days ago.

33
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:49,854
She moved to Tampa.

34
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:52,465
She ask for money or some shit?

35
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:53,466
No.

36
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,729
She asked about you.

37
00:04:56,904 --> 00:04:58,384
You should call her sometime.

38
00:04:58,428 --> 00:05:01,387
I got enough
I'm dealing with here.

39
00:05:03,476 --> 00:05:05,870
Did you pick up
my car registration?

40
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:08,133
Yeah.

41
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:09,395
I got it at home.

42
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,223
Spent all morning
waiting for it.

43
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:16,837
Got it online.

44
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:18,709
Everything's online.

45
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:21,973
Can't get a real human being
if you try.

46
00:05:22,016 --> 00:05:24,367
Didn't stop them
from charging me $23.

47
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,020
I'll pay it.

48
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:28,022
That's not what I meant.

49
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:29,720
I know.

50
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:35,856
SHARON:
There's a bag of things

51
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,945
by the front door
for you to take.

52
00:05:37,989 --> 00:05:40,818
And an envelope of photos
in on her desk.

53
00:05:40,861 --> 00:05:42,080
Those are important.

54
00:06:11,152 --> 00:06:12,806
WOMAN:
Okay, you have two stopovers,

55
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,026
the first in Atlanta,
the second in Frankfurt.

56
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:17,115
-You're at gate 22.
-Thank you.

57
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,991
I just need
your signature please.

58
00:07:09,602 --> 00:07:12,344
-You are with us for two weeks?
-Yes, ma'am.

59
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,303
Thanks.

60
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:18,306
Here's your key. Room 156.

61
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,352
Thank you, ma'am.

62
00:07:21,527 --> 00:07:23,268
Welcome back, Mr. Baker.

63
00:07:24,574 --> 00:07:26,358
Hey.

64
00:07:26,401 --> 00:07:28,447
-

65
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,538
Oh, pardon.

66
00:07:32,582 --> 00:07:33,974
Merci.

67
00:07:56,431 --> 00:07:57,432
-

68
00:07:57,476 --> 00:07:59,130
Hey. Hey.

69
00:07:59,173 --> 00:08:01,001
Y'all mind keeping it down?
I'm trying to sleep.

70
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:03,177
-The music.
-Hein?

71
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:04,570
-

72
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:06,311
-No-no English.
-

73
00:08:06,354 --> 00:08:07,617
-No speak English.
-

74
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,009
Yeah, all right.

75
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:10,184
Hey, good night.

76
00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:20,368
-

77
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:33,599

Merci.

82
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,475
-Hey, baby girl.
- Hey, Dad.

83
00:09:24,694 --> 00:09:26,739
You look good.

84
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,741
:
Thanks.

85
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:30,613
How was the flight?

86
00:09:30,656 --> 00:09:33,006
Okay.

87
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,399
You doing all right?

88
00:09:34,442 --> 00:09:36,662
-I'm okay, yeah.
-Good.

89
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,187
Good.
You got some laundry for me?

90
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:41,667
Yeah. Some.

91
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:43,408
I'll get it done.

92
00:09:46,585 --> 00:09:48,456
They gave us
two more visiting days.

93
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,589
The next one's, uh, Friday,
2:00 p.m.

94
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:52,635
How's Gram?

95
00:09:52,678 --> 00:09:53,766
She's good.

96
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,247
Still got the oxygen tank.

97
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,641
Still got plenty of opinions.

98
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:02,166
Miss her.

99
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:04,211
She bought you
everything you wanted.

100
00:10:04,255 --> 00:10:05,691
Uh, we got you a extra pair
of socks

101
00:10:05,735 --> 00:10:08,259
and, uh, good new pair
of sneakers.

102
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,044
Thanks.

103
00:10:11,088 --> 00:10:14,221
Uh, Gram said that she was
giving you some photos for me.

104
00:10:14,265 --> 00:10:16,702
Ah, shit. I forgot them.

105
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:18,312
Oh, just bring them next time.

106
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:20,488
No, I mean I forgot them
at home in Stillwater.

107
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:22,142
Sorry.

108
00:10:22,186 --> 00:10:23,622
Doesn't matter.

109
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:26,494
I got you, uh, a Cowboys
sweatshirt at the airport.

110
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:28,148
They're gonna be good
this year.

111
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:31,586
They got this big ol' tight end
out of Guthrie.

112
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,501
Takes about three guys
to bring him down.

113
00:10:33,545 --> 00:10:35,721
He gonna go pro for sure.

114
00:10:36,853 --> 00:10:38,376
Cool.

115
00:10:39,377 --> 00:10:41,248
You still working
at the library?

116
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:42,728
No, I quit.

117
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:45,688
Um, Dad, I need you
to do something.

118
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:49,213
I need you
to get that to Leparq,

119
00:10:49,256 --> 00:10:50,693
make sure she reads it.

120
00:10:50,736 --> 00:10:52,216
-Okay?
-Wh-What is it?

121
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:55,175
It's-it's a letter.
Just give it to her.

122
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:57,438
-Yeah, yeah. -The-the address
is on the envelope, okay?

123
00:10:57,482 --> 00:10:58,831
Yeah, okay.

124
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,659
But are you good?

125
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:03,314
Dad, please.

126
00:11:03,357 --> 00:11:05,185
I'll do it today.

127
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:06,578
I'll make sure she reads it.

128
00:11:06,621 --> 00:11:08,319
Okay.

129
00:11:10,277 --> 00:11:12,192
Mind if we pray a bit?

130
00:11:13,193 --> 00:11:14,847
Yeah, sure, Dad.

131
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:18,416
Thank you, Lord,

132
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:20,113
for bringing us together
on this blessed day and

133
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:21,854
thank you for keeping
a watchful eye on Allison.

134
00:11:42,657 --> 00:11:45,399
Mr. Baker.

135
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:47,358
I'm sorry you had to wait,
but Maître Leparq

136
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:49,795
is not coming back
to the office today.

137
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,754
I'll come back tomorrow, then.
Thank you, ma'am.

138
00:11:51,797 --> 00:11:54,234
Mr. Baker,
she's in court all week.

139
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:55,583
Why don't you give me
your letter

140
00:11:55,627 --> 00:11:57,281
and I will make sure
she gets it.

141
00:11:57,324 --> 00:11:58,761
Can't do that.
Thank you, ma'am.

142
00:11:58,804 --> 00:12:01,111
-As you wish.
-

143
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:10,642
-Bonjour.
-Hey.

144
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,652
You locked out?

145
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:23,307
Quoi?

146
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:25,744
Key. You got a key?

147
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:27,485
Ah, euh, non.

148
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:30,793

Come on, let's go get it.

149
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,580
Come on.
I'm gonna get you a new key.

00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:45,851

Closer.

154

00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:53,467
-Hmm?
-You.

156

Maya. Ah, that's nice.

158
00:12:58,342 --> 00:12:59,691
CÇ'est quoi?

159
00:12:59,734 --> 00:13:02,694
It's a tattoo.

160
00:13:02,737 --> 00:13:05,479
-Hmm?

161
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:08,352
Oh, it's a eagle.

162
00:13:08,395 --> 00:13:09,744
-Eagle?

163

Bald eagle. America.

164

Yeah, and I got a skull
with a knife going through it.

168
00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:35,727
Afternoon. I'm looking for, uh,
for that person, Maître Leparq.

169
00:13:56,748 --> 00:13:58,576
Ms. Leparq?

170
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:01,709
-Mr. Baker?
-Yes, ma'am.

171
00:14:01,753 --> 00:14:03,015
I just need a few minutes
of your time.

172
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:05,713
Letter from my daughter.

173
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:09,543
LEPARQ:
I'm sorry, Mr. Baker,

174
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:12,459
but I cannot honor
your daughter's request.

175
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:13,852
Why's that?

176
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:17,334
Mr. Baker, a judge
will not reopen this case

177
00:14:17,377 --> 00:14:18,726
based on hearsay.

178
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,424
This is not possible.

179
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:22,774
Okay.

180
00:14:22,817 --> 00:14:26,386
We have exhausted
every possible legal action.

181
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,562
This letter tells me
that your daughter

182
00:14:28,606 --> 00:14:30,825
has not accepted her sentence.

183
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:31,914
And she must.

184
00:14:31,957 --> 00:14:33,741
Do you understand?

185
00:14:33,785 --> 00:14:35,004
Yes, ma'am.

186
00:14:35,047 --> 00:14:36,744
I must go.

187
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:38,703
I have a full day.

188
00:14:38,746 --> 00:14:40,705
Can I get that letter back?

189
00:14:41,706 --> 00:14:42,925
As you wish.

190
00:14:42,968 --> 00:14:44,796
-Thank you.
-Mr. Baker,

191
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:48,582
there's a time for hope and
there's a time for acceptance.

192
00:14:48,626 --> 00:14:52,760
The last thing you want to give
your daughter is false hope.

193
00:14:52,804 --> 00:14:54,980
That could make her situation
very dire.

194
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:57,069
Do you understand?

195
00:14:57,113 --> 00:14:58,636
Yes, ma'am.

196
00:15:26,881 --> 00:15:27,970
Hello.

197
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:30,624
Hey.

198
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:33,627
Uh, thank you for helping
my daughter Maya yesterday.

199
00:15:33,671 --> 00:15:36,326
I was a little bit late
coming back.

200
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:38,632
It's, uh, you know,
we're between apartments,

201
00:15:38,676 --> 00:15:41,635
and we don't have electricity
at our new place.

202
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:42,810
So...

203
00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:44,856
Sorry, I...

204
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:46,379
I don't speak English.

205
00:15:47,641 --> 00:15:49,513
Oh, yes.

206
00:15:49,556 --> 00:15:51,645
The balcony. Yeah.

207
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:54,997
Um, well, my-my English
came back to me.

208
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,477
Uh, I'm-I'm sorry
for the loud noise.

209
00:15:57,521 --> 00:15:59,088
It's because of
my girlfriend Nedjma.

210
00:15:59,131 --> 00:16:01,003
She's a bad influence on me.

211
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:03,701
I'm, uh, Virginie.

212
00:16:03,744 --> 00:16:04,832
I'm Bill.

213
00:16:04,876 --> 00:16:06,443
Hello, Bill.

214
00:16:06,486 --> 00:16:08,488
You're in Marseille
for vacation?

215
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:10,534
Uh, visiting my daughter.

216
00:16:10,577 --> 00:16:11,709
It's cool.

217
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:15,147
Well, hopefully we're only here
for one or two more days,

218
00:16:15,191 --> 00:16:17,845
but if you need anything,
you know, we're next door.

219
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:19,543
Thank you, ma'am.

220
00:16:19,586 --> 00:16:21,632
Thank you. Bye, Bill.

221
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:29,857
VIRGINIE:
"Dear Maître Leparq,

222
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:33,905
"I'm writing to you

"and got away with it.

230
00:16:57,015 --> 00:17:01,541
It must be the same Akim
who killed Lina."

231
00:17:03,848 --> 00:17:07,765
You're the father of the girl,

Yes, ma'am.

I'm sorry.

249
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,996
Appreciate your help.

250
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,006
Please don't say anything
to anybody about this.

251
00:18:15,049 --> 00:18:17,226
Oui, bien sûr.

252
00:18:26,887 --> 00:18:28,933
Mr. Baker. Please, this way.

253
00:18:32,676 --> 00:18:34,721
So, how can I help you?

254
00:18:35,722 --> 00:18:37,985
Well, I want to see Mrs. Leparq
about the case.

255
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:40,162
Maître Leparq
is not available today.

256
00:18:42,729 --> 00:18:45,776
There's a new lead.

257
00:18:45,819 --> 00:18:47,560
This guy...

258
00:18:47,604 --> 00:18:50,084
was talking at a party
about the murder.

259
00:18:50,128 --> 00:18:52,217
-Mr. Baker... -So somebody
needs to talk to this teacher,

260
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:53,827
this guy, Patrick Okonedo.

261
00:18:53,871 --> 00:18:55,786
We need to hear
what he has to say.

262
00:18:55,829 --> 00:19:00,007
Mr. Baker, Maître Leparq was
very clear with you yesterday.

263
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:01,835
She cannot pursue this case.

264
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:04,838
But if you wish to pursue
a further investigation,

265
00:19:04,882 --> 00:19:07,667
we can recommend this.

266
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:10,061
It's a list of private
detectives you can engage.

267
00:19:10,104 --> 00:19:11,845
No, I don't want,
I don't want a detective.

268
00:19:11,889 --> 00:19:13,847
We have worked with
the people on this list,

269
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:15,327
and they're all very capable.

270
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:17,242
I don't care how capable
they are. I don't want...

271
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:19,679
-I'm circling the names that
you can... -Stop circling that.

272
00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:22,029
-My daughter's in fucking jail.
-

273
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:23,988
I don't need some fucking list.

274
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:26,556
Euh, ça va?

275
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:29,167
Oui, oui, ça va, oui.

276
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:32,039
Merci.

277
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:37,219
As you want.

278
00:19:38,263 --> 00:19:39,917
Fuck this.

279
00:19:57,848 --> 00:19:59,241
Merci, Sybille.

280
00:19:59,284 --> 00:20:00,981
-Hey. Mm.
-Hi.

281
00:20:02,113 --> 00:20:04,071
-You good?
-Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

282
00:20:04,115 --> 00:20:06,291
Let you out a bit late today.
They shouldn't do that.

283
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:08,293
You know they're gonna
call you back in on time.

284
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:10,252
It's okay.
It happens sometimes.

285
00:20:10,295 --> 00:20:12,254
-I did your laundry.
-Thanks.

286
00:20:12,297 --> 00:20:14,734
Um, did you give
my letter to Leparq?

287
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:16,823
Yeah, of course.

288
00:20:17,824 --> 00:20:19,348
And what'd she say?

289
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:25,092
Well, uh, she told me
what you wrote about Akim

290
00:20:25,136 --> 00:20:27,747
-and the girl at the party.
-And what'd she say?

291
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,401
Well, she said, you know,

292
00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:32,012
she works on
a lot of these cases...

293
00:20:32,056 --> 00:20:34,014
Dad.

294
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:37,104
Is she gonna
investigate it or not?

295
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:39,150
Just tell me.

296
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:42,632
Yeah, she's gonna look into it.

297
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,286
Really?

298
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:47,289
She said that?

299
00:20:47,332 --> 00:20:49,116
She said
she's gonna look into it?

300
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,031
That's right.

301
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:53,207
I told her how strongly
you felt about it.

302
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:55,645
Does she need me
to do anything?

303
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:59,823
No. She said she just needs
some time, and, uh...

304
00:20:59,866 --> 00:21:03,305
She did say, uh, she didn't
want to make any promises.

305
00:21:03,348 --> 00:21:06,351
She-she didn't want
to give you any false hope

306
00:21:06,395 --> 00:21:07,874
-or nothing like that.
-No, no, no, no, no.

307
00:21:07,918 --> 00:21:09,876
But that's-that's still great.

308
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,878
Akim exists.

309
00:21:11,922 --> 00:21:13,445
He killed Lina.

310
00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:14,838
I know.

311
00:21:14,881 --> 00:21:16,796
-I know that.
-

312
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,276
You have no idea how many times

313
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,234
I-I wrote and then rewrote
that letter.

314
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:21,453
:
Oh, my God.

315
00:21:21,497 --> 00:21:23,150
Well, it worked.

316
00:21:23,194 --> 00:21:24,935
:
Yeah.

317
00:21:24,978 --> 00:21:27,024
Maybe God answered our prayers.

318
00:21:27,067 --> 00:21:28,895
Thank you, Dad.

319
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:31,202
Thank you so much.

320
00:21:47,131 --> 00:21:48,393
Excuse me, ma'am.

321
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:51,265
Bill Baker.
Called about a list.

322
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:53,224
One moment please.

323
00:21:53,267 --> 00:21:55,139
BILL: I don't know
how much you remember

324
00:21:55,182 --> 00:21:57,837
about the case, but
Allison came here for college,

325
00:21:57,881 --> 00:22:00,231
and that's where
she met this girl, Lina.

326
00:22:00,274 --> 00:22:02,451
Allison and Lina were...
together,

327
00:22:02,494 --> 00:22:04,844
and one night
they got in a big fight,

328
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:06,846
and Allison went to a bar.

329
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,414
That's where she met
this Akim guy.

330
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:10,894
And they had some drinks.

331
00:22:10,937 --> 00:22:13,375
He stole her purse, and...

332
00:22:13,418 --> 00:22:15,420
when Allison got home,
she found Lina dead

333
00:22:15,464 --> 00:22:17,291
and called the police.

334
00:22:17,335 --> 00:22:19,250
And they never could find
this Akim.

335
00:22:19,293 --> 00:22:21,818
He's the one who killed Lina.

336
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:24,908
What do you think?

337
00:22:27,084 --> 00:22:28,477
Mm-hmm.

338
00:22:29,478 --> 00:22:31,393
You speak English, right?

339
00:22:32,437 --> 00:22:33,786
English?

340
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,745
Yes. I am.

341
00:22:36,528 --> 00:22:38,095
:
Fuck.

342
00:22:39,444 --> 00:22:41,359
Give me back the letter.

343
00:22:58,202 --> 00:23:00,117
:
Mr. Baker.

344
00:23:01,074 --> 00:23:03,294
Please.

345
00:23:03,337 --> 00:23:05,209
My office.

346
00:23:05,252 --> 00:23:09,126
I was in service
at the time of this case.

347
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:11,215
In the police.

348
00:23:11,258 --> 00:23:13,522
Have you talked
to this Okonedo?

349
00:23:13,565 --> 00:23:16,089
-The professor.
-No, sir.

350
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:20,920
I see why your lawyer
doesn't want to help.

351
00:23:20,964 --> 00:23:24,228
Some kid at a party
hears gossip about a murder.

352
00:23:24,271 --> 00:23:26,448
Maybe she remembers
this famous case.

353
00:23:26,491 --> 00:23:29,276
Why now? It was five years ago.

354
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,063
That's... that's how long my
kid's been in jail, five years.

355
00:23:34,368 --> 00:23:36,501
Does she know we are meeting?

356
00:23:36,545 --> 00:23:37,937
Your kid.

357
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:39,417
No, sir.

358
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,469
Are you rich, Mr. Baker?

359
00:23:48,513 --> 00:23:49,862
No, sir.

360
00:23:49,906 --> 00:23:52,517
This is a DNA case.

361
00:23:52,561 --> 00:23:54,345
It means two steps.

362
00:23:54,388 --> 00:23:57,261
First, I look for
the young man.

363
00:23:57,304 --> 00:23:59,045
That will not be easy.

364
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:02,266
People will talk.
He will try to disappear.

365
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:05,356
Then, if I find this Akim,

366
00:24:05,399 --> 00:24:07,532
I have to get
a sample of his DNA

367
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:10,970
and use my connections
in the police to test it

368
00:24:11,014 --> 00:24:13,364
against the DNA
from the crime scene.

369
00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:16,280
How much?

370
00:24:23,592 --> 00:24:25,942
$12,000?

371
00:24:25,985 --> 00:24:27,857
Euros.

372
00:24:30,294 --> 00:24:32,339
Thank you for your time.

373
00:24:33,384 --> 00:24:35,342
Mr. Baker.

374
00:24:35,386 --> 00:24:38,215
Do you believe
your daughter is innocent?

375
00:24:38,258 --> 00:24:40,217
I know she is.

376
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:45,091
Then maybe it's not so much
to see her go free.

377
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,617
-Excuse me, ma'am.
-Yes?

378
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:35,228
-Ask you a question, please?
-Yes, of course.

379
00:25:35,272 --> 00:25:38,362
I'm just too much of a dumbass
to figure this out on my own.

380
00:25:38,405 --> 00:25:39,624
I don't speak French.

381
00:25:39,668 --> 00:25:42,018
Uh, how can I help you?

382
00:25:42,061 --> 00:25:43,410
I'm looking for a guy,

383
00:25:43,454 --> 00:25:45,456
uh, who works here.

384
00:26:01,472 --> 00:26:03,648
-Oui?
-Sorry to interrupt.

385
00:26:05,345 --> 00:26:06,477
Do you speak English?

386
00:26:09,262 --> 00:26:11,525
I do.

387
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:13,484
Looking for Patrick Okonedo.

388
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,401
-Have a seat please.

389
00:26:17,444 --> 00:26:18,750
That's all right.
I'll wait outside.

390
00:26:18,794 --> 00:26:21,666
No, no, please. Join the party.

391
00:26:37,464 --> 00:26:38,683
It's impressive, huh?

392
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,123
It's the kind of office
a PhD will get you.

393
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:45,995
Mint tea.

394
00:26:47,736 --> 00:26:50,129
I want to talk to the girl
you told Allison about

395
00:26:50,173 --> 00:26:51,304
from the party.

396
00:26:51,348 --> 00:26:53,567
Yes. I assumed as much.

397
00:26:54,699 --> 00:26:57,310
To be honest, I've always felt
guilty about what happened.

398
00:26:57,354 --> 00:26:59,312
I should've warned Allison.

399
00:26:59,356 --> 00:27:01,227
Warned her? About what?

400
00:27:01,271 --> 00:27:03,403
Well, I knew Allison and Lina
were sleeping together,

401
00:27:03,447 --> 00:27:06,580
but I had no idea
Lina had moved in with her.

402
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:10,367
I try to not be cynical about
these type of relationships--

403
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,456
poor girl from the ghetto,
rich American student--

404
00:27:12,499 --> 00:27:14,632
but then I end up
being guilty of naivete.

405
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:16,155
Allison grew up poor.

406
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:17,461
She isn't rich.

407
00:27:17,504 --> 00:27:19,637
Educated.

408
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:22,509
There is a lot of resentments
towards the cultural elite.

409
00:27:22,553 --> 00:27:24,294
But I'm sure
you're aware of that.

410
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:27,558
What about the girl
from the party?

411
00:27:27,601 --> 00:27:28,820
-My student?
-Yeah.

412
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:30,735
Her name is Souad.

413
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:32,389
She's from
the outreach program,

414
00:27:32,432 --> 00:27:33,651
the same one Lina and Allison

415
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:35,348
were involved with
when they met.

416
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:37,699
And she heard some guy
talking about Lina's murder?

417
00:27:37,742 --> 00:27:40,484
This is what she told me.

418
00:27:40,527 --> 00:27:42,355
Could I talk to her?

419
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,053
She'll talk to you, yes.

420
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:46,533
I'll give you her phone number.

421
00:27:47,534 --> 00:27:50,712
Souad doesn't speak English
very well.

422
00:27:50,755 --> 00:27:52,365
You will need someone
to translate.

423
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:55,151
Oh, could you do that for me?

424
00:27:56,152 --> 00:27:57,719
No, I'd rather not.

425
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:01,244
I'm still running
the outreach program.

426
00:28:01,287 --> 00:28:02,724
I cannot be associated with you.

427
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:05,727
Or your daughter,
after what happened.

428
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,598
Whatever my personal opinion
may be.

429
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:10,340
My daughter's innocent.

430
00:28:15,258 --> 00:28:17,521
I wish you good luck.

431
00:28:17,564 --> 00:28:19,610
-

432
00:28:28,314 --> 00:28:31,143
BILL: Hey, Patricia,
afraid I need some help again.

433
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:34,146
I'm supposed to attend a
very special birthday tomorrow,

434
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,800
and I lost the address.

435
00:28:53,905 --> 00:28:55,602
:
Bonjour?

436
00:28:55,646 --> 00:28:56,865
BILL:
Hi. It's Bill Baker.

437
00:28:56,908 --> 00:28:58,823
Pardon?

438
00:28:58,867 --> 00:29:01,826
-Bill, from the hotel.
-Ah, Bill.

439
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,436
Yeah, I was stopping by.
Sorry to...

440
00:29:04,655 --> 00:29:06,831
-Uh, last floor.
-All right.

441
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:11,662
Hi, Bill.

442
00:29:11,705 --> 00:29:13,838
Hey, Maya.

443
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:15,622
I got something for you.

444
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:17,624
It's a robot.

445
00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:26,764
-Hi.
-Hi. Sorry to intrude.

446
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:28,505
No, it's okay. Come in.

447
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:31,595
Um, I have some friends over.

448
00:29:31,638 --> 00:29:33,292
Oh.

449
00:29:33,336 --> 00:29:34,816
How did you find us?

450
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:36,818
Oh, the lady at reception
gave me your address

451
00:29:36,861 --> 00:29:38,602
'cause there's this girl
I need to call,

452
00:29:38,645 --> 00:29:41,866
but she don't speak English,
and it's kind of personal.

453
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,868
Ah, you want me to make the
call for you. Is that right?

454
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:45,304
Yes, ma'am, but I'll come back
another time.

455
00:29:45,348 --> 00:29:47,176
No, it's fine.
Uh, just come in.

456
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:48,873
Just let me grab my phone.

457
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:50,527
Come.

458
00:29:53,704 --> 00:29:54,836
-Hey.

459
00:29:54,879 --> 00:29:56,750
VIRGINIE:
Bill, this is, uh,

460
00:29:56,794 --> 00:29:59,449
the crème de la crme
of the Marseille theater scene.

461
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,758
VIRGINIE:
Ouais.

462
00:30:06,543 --> 00:30:08,675
Uh, we're doing
this, uh, mask exercise.

463
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:09,851
-All right.
-Yeah.

464
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:12,636
Excuse the mess.

465
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:14,377
This is going to be my office,
but we're still moving in.

466
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,248
Have a seat.

467
00:30:16,292 --> 00:30:17,597
So, who am I calling?

468
00:30:17,641 --> 00:30:19,338
Um...

469
00:30:19,382 --> 00:30:21,297
the girl from the letter.

470
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,908
-Ah, it's about the case?
-Yes, ma'am.

471
00:30:23,952 --> 00:30:25,649
I want to meet with her.

472
00:30:25,692 --> 00:30:27,912
Is the lawyer not helping you?

473
00:30:27,956 --> 00:30:30,915
Uh, doing it myself for now.

474
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:32,917
Oh. Wow.

475
00:30:32,961 --> 00:30:34,397
Okay. Um...

476
00:30:36,573 --> 00:30:39,228
-Oui.
-Um...

477
00:30:45,582 --> 00:30:47,018
What a great deal,
I got this place

478
00:30:47,062 --> 00:30:49,499
through this friend of mine.

479
00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:53,329
I fell in love with this view,
but, uh, has a few defects.

480
00:30:54,373 --> 00:30:55,853
Probably just
a circuit breaker.

481
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:57,463
I could look at it if you want.

482
00:30:57,507 --> 00:30:59,988
-Yeah. You know how to do that?
-Yes, ma'am.

483
00:31:00,031 --> 00:31:02,381
Well, that would be great.

484
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:04,514
Souad? Souad?

485
00:31:04,557 --> 00:31:06,255
Oui, bonjour. Souad?

486
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:07,256
Bonjour.

487
00:31:10,955 --> 00:31:12,565
...Bill Baker.

488
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:14,480
Bill Baker...

489
00:31:14,524 --> 00:31:16,265
Oh, non.

490
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:21,748
Let me see. Let me see.

491
00:31:25,535 --> 00:31:27,580
Hey
-Cool.

492
00:31:27,624 --> 00:31:29,669
Sexy lady...
-

493
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:33,935
I didn't know it did that.

494
00:31:41,507 --> 00:31:44,597
That-that goes on easy.
Hold on. There you go.

495
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:45,990
Looks good.

496
00:31:47,731 --> 00:31:48,950
VIRGINIE:
Merci beaucoup.

497
00:31:48,993 --> 00:31:51,082
Au revoir.

498
00:31:51,126 --> 00:31:54,651
Okay. She agrees to see you
tomorrow at 6:00.

499
00:31:54,694 --> 00:31:56,609
All right.

500
00:31:56,653 --> 00:31:58,437
Um, she was nice.

501
00:31:58,481 --> 00:32:00,309
Bit shy.

502
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:02,311
So how are you gonna talk to
her if you don't speak French?

503
00:32:03,138 --> 00:32:04,966
Well, that's a fair question.

504
00:32:05,009 --> 00:32:07,011
I'll figure it out.

505
00:32:07,055 --> 00:32:08,621
Okay.

506
00:32:08,665 --> 00:32:10,623
Well, I could come
and translate if you need.

507
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,495
You sure?

508
00:32:12,538 --> 00:32:14,627
Uh, yeah.

509
00:32:14,671 --> 00:32:17,891
Yeah, Maya has art class,
so if you come here at 5:30,

510
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:19,545
then we take my car.

511
00:32:20,546 --> 00:32:21,895
Appreciate it.

512
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:23,332
Uh, you show me
where that fuse box is,

513
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:24,550
I'll work on
that breaker for you.

514
00:32:24,594 --> 00:32:26,335
No, it's okay.

515
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:27,727
You don't have to do that.

516
00:32:27,771 --> 00:32:29,425
Oh, non, non.

517
00:32:30,469 --> 00:32:32,819
Just give me that damn thing.
I-- Come on.

518
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:38,521
MAYA:
Bill!

519
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,394
Bye, Bill!

520
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:45,528
Bye.

521
00:32:55,494 --> 00:32:57,844
VIRGINIE: I have to confess,
uh, I went online and I read

522
00:32:57,888 --> 00:32:59,716
about Allison's case.

523
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:01,848
It was a big story at the time.

524
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:04,938
I mean, the-the press
was ferocious, no?

525
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:07,985
Y-You say "f-ferocious"?

526
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:10,770
-Yes, ma'am, we say that.
-Yeah?

527
00:33:10,814 --> 00:33:13,425
-Putain.

528
00:33:13,469 --> 00:33:15,036
Dumbass.

529
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:16,820
Yeah, people--
they don't know how to drive

530
00:33:16,863 --> 00:33:18,126
in this fucking town.

531
00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:20,389
It's a crazy place, Marseille.

532
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:22,173
But I still prefer it to Paris.

533
00:33:22,217 --> 00:33:25,437
You know, people actually
talk to each other here.

534
00:33:25,481 --> 00:33:27,526
And plus, it's cheaper.

535
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,139
And why did Allison
come here for school?

536
00:33:31,182 --> 00:33:32,618
I'm curious.

537
00:33:32,662 --> 00:33:35,012
-Don't know.
-No?

538
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:37,058
Yeah, she was going
to Oklahoma State.

539
00:33:37,101 --> 00:33:39,016
She just called me up
one day, said,

540
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,062
"I'm going to France," to here.

541
00:33:42,106 --> 00:33:43,803
She's independent.

542
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:46,545
Yes, ma'am. Always been.

543
00:33:46,589 --> 00:33:47,764
Are you close?

544
00:33:48,939 --> 00:33:50,680
Well, you read her letter.

545
00:33:51,898 --> 00:33:53,900
And where is her mother?

546
00:33:53,944 --> 00:33:55,728
She passed.

547
00:33:55,772 --> 00:33:57,078
Killed herself.

548
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,648
Allison was raised
by her grandmother mostly.

549
00:34:02,692 --> 00:34:04,085
I wasn't around much.

550
00:34:04,128 --> 00:34:05,564
Where were you?

551
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:08,828
Working oil rigs and...

552
00:34:08,872 --> 00:34:10,874
being a fuckup when I wasn't.

553
00:34:12,789 --> 00:34:14,834
It's not easy
being a single parent.

554
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:17,489
I often work at night, and
Maya, she gets really upset.

555
00:34:17,533 --> 00:34:19,752
-What do you do?
-I'm an actress.

556
00:34:19,796 --> 00:34:21,841
-Oh, on TV?
-No.

557
00:34:21,885 --> 00:34:23,930
Theater.

558
00:34:23,974 --> 00:34:25,584
Do you go to theater?

559
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:27,760
No, ma'am.

560
00:34:27,804 --> 00:34:29,936
-Never?
-No, ma'am.

561
00:34:31,851 --> 00:34:33,462
Okay.

562
00:34:38,858 --> 00:34:40,817
BILL: Uh, thank y'all
for talking to me.

563
00:34:42,253 --> 00:34:45,169
So, this guy that she met
at the party, Akim--

564
00:34:45,213 --> 00:34:48,694
uh, anything she could
tell us about him?

565
00:34:55,745 --> 00:34:58,182
She said he was quiet and nice.

566
00:34:58,226 --> 00:34:59,662
Nice?

567
00:35:04,275 --> 00:35:06,625
And then he told her friend
he'd stabbed a girl

568
00:35:06,669 --> 00:35:08,975
and that the police
never caught him.

569
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:10,803
-So...
-BILL: Okay.

570
00:35:10,847 --> 00:35:12,501
Does she know where he lives?

571
00:35:18,333 --> 00:35:20,204
BILL:
Does she know where he lives?

572
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:25,688
-AÀ Kalliste.
-Kalliste?

573
00:35:25,731 --> 00:35:27,864
VIRGINIE: She says he lives
in a different project.

574
00:35:27,907 --> 00:35:29,648
It's called Kalliste.

575
00:35:41,704 --> 00:35:43,184
-BILL: What's she saying?
-Nothing helpful.

576
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:47,666
I-I'm, uh... le père.

577
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:50,103
Uh, Allison.

578
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:52,018
That's my little girl.

579
00:35:52,062 --> 00:35:54,064
Allison is my... ma fille.

580
00:35:54,107 --> 00:35:56,153
You understand?

581
00:36:03,726 --> 00:36:05,945
She doesn't want to help.

582
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:07,947
Can she tell me anything?

583
00:36:07,991 --> 00:36:09,645
Wh-What does this guy
look like?

584
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:18,915
-Where they going?
-They're leaving.

585
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:20,830
Uh, no, no, no. Hold on,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

586
00:36:20,873 --> 00:36:23,224
Wait, no, no. Hold on.
Just wait. No, no.

587
00:36:23,267 --> 00:36:24,355
-All right, all right.
-Wouah, wouah, wouah! Wouah!

588
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:26,966
Souad. Hey, Souad! Souad!

589
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,838
Bill, Bill, let them go, okay?
She's afraid.

590
00:36:28,881 --> 00:36:30,274
Afraid of what?
I'm talking to her.

591
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:31,971
Yeah, but that's not
how it works here.

592
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:33,582
Well, you tell me
how it works then,

593
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:34,931
'cause nobody here's
doing shit for me.

594
00:36:34,974 --> 00:36:37,020
VIRGINIE:
I do shit for you, okay?

595
00:36:37,063 --> 00:36:40,197
We should go. Now.

596
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:42,243
Okay?

597
00:36:43,244 --> 00:36:44,897
-Yeah, all right.
-All right?

598
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:56,126
VIRGINIE:
That's it. Kalliste.

599
00:36:56,169 --> 00:36:58,128
That's where she says
Akim lives.

600
00:36:58,171 --> 00:36:59,956
Well, can we go look around?

601
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:01,653
No. Not at this time.

602
00:37:01,697 --> 00:37:04,265
It's not safe for us.

603
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:05,875
'Cause we're white?

604
00:37:07,877 --> 00:37:10,053
'Cause we're not from there.

605
00:37:10,096 --> 00:37:12,273
And there's a lot of dealing.

606
00:37:12,316 --> 00:37:14,100
Well, I got to do something.

607
00:37:14,144 --> 00:37:16,277
No one will talk to you,
trust me.

608
00:37:18,017 --> 00:37:20,933
Bill, what if there's no Akim?

609
00:37:20,977 --> 00:37:22,935
There is.

610
00:37:22,979 --> 00:37:25,024
Okay, but they never
found this person

611
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:26,809
during the investigation.

612
00:37:26,852 --> 00:37:28,332
My daughter's not a liar.

613
00:37:28,376 --> 00:37:29,942
No, I didn't say she was.

614
00:37:29,986 --> 00:37:31,379
It's just that everything
I read about the case...

615
00:37:31,422 --> 00:37:33,642
So you're some kind
of expert now?

616
00:37:35,426 --> 00:37:37,080
No, I'm not.

617
00:37:41,737 --> 00:37:43,652
The press was against us.

618
00:37:44,827 --> 00:37:46,742
All they cared about was

619
00:37:46,785 --> 00:37:49,179
Allison was sleeping
with some Arab girl.

620
00:37:50,223 --> 00:37:51,964
Bunch of...

621
00:37:52,008 --> 00:37:53,705
fake news scumbags.

622
00:37:55,185 --> 00:37:57,230
That's why you punched
that English reporter?

623
00:37:59,885 --> 00:38:02,105
I was drinking then.

624
00:38:12,028 --> 00:38:14,160
ALLISON: Hey, did you
tell Gram about Leparq?

625
00:38:14,204 --> 00:38:16,032
No.

626
00:38:16,075 --> 00:38:19,340
No, I didn't want to get her
hopes up until we know more.

627
00:38:19,383 --> 00:38:21,342
She's getting on,
your grandmother.

628
00:38:23,082 --> 00:38:25,346
Oh, I had a meeting
with the judge yesterday.

629
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:28,349
Oh, yeah? About what?

630
00:38:28,392 --> 00:38:29,872
Well, I have my parole review

631
00:38:29,915 --> 00:38:31,917
coming up
in about three months.

632
00:38:31,961 --> 00:38:34,093
And, uh, it's the thing
where I get out of here

633
00:38:34,137 --> 00:38:35,094
one day a month.

634
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:36,487
Yeah, okay.

635
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:39,142
-So what'd he say?
-She. She said.

636
00:38:39,185 --> 00:38:43,015
Uh, you know, as long as
my behavior remained good,

637
00:38:43,059 --> 00:38:44,495
shouldn't be a problem.

638
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:47,803
I felt like saying,
"Fuck parole.

639
00:38:47,846 --> 00:38:49,848
My lawyer's working on getting
me out of here for good."

640
00:38:49,892 --> 00:38:51,459
No, we don't know that yet,
Ally.

641
00:38:51,502 --> 00:38:53,852
-You got to keep...
-I know, I know, I know, Dad.

642
00:38:53,896 --> 00:38:57,029
I-I didn't say that.
But I wanted to.

643
00:38:57,073 --> 00:39:00,076
And... somebody from
Leparq's office was there.

644
00:39:01,077 --> 00:39:02,513
Oh, yeah?

645
00:39:02,557 --> 00:39:05,255
Yeah. I never met her,
but I asked her

646
00:39:05,298 --> 00:39:07,344
how the investigation was going.

647
00:39:08,301 --> 00:39:09,868
What'd she tell you?

648
00:39:09,912 --> 00:39:11,740
She said she didn't know
anything about it,

649
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:14,090
but she also said
she just started working there.

650
00:39:15,091 --> 00:39:16,919
Leparq's probably
taking care of it herself.

651
00:39:16,962 --> 00:39:18,399
It's a big case.

652
00:39:18,442 --> 00:39:19,878
:
Yeah.

653
00:39:19,922 --> 00:39:21,880
I told her I wanted
to talk to Leparq.

654
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:23,404
She should be
keeping us informed.

655
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:25,362
-You know what I mean?
-I'll talk to her.

656
00:39:28,017 --> 00:39:30,976
Okay. Well...

657
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,761
I'll see you in a couple days.

658
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:34,806
Uh, Dad, do you think that
you could stay in Marseille

659
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,242
a little longer?

660
00:39:36,286 --> 00:39:37,983
Just in case
something comes up.

661
00:39:38,984 --> 00:39:40,203
Yeah, I could do that.

662
00:39:40,246 --> 00:39:43,249
I'll check in on work
and stuff.

663
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,862
I-I can have Gram wire you
some money if you need.

664
00:39:46,905 --> 00:39:48,820
No, no, don't do that.
I-I'll figure it out.

665
00:39:48,864 --> 00:39:50,300
Thanks, Dad.

666
00:39:51,344 --> 00:39:52,955
Bye.

667
00:40:06,272 --> 00:40:08,274
Uh, Max.

668
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:09,885
Salut.

669
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:13,949
-D'accord.
-Ay.

670
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:18,997
Now, once the oil company
has a lease--

671
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:20,390
Give it here, M.

672
00:41:20,433 --> 00:41:21,522
Come on.

673
00:41:22,566 --> 00:41:25,351
Once that oil company
has that lease,

674
00:41:25,395 --> 00:41:27,223
they hire a drilling company.

675
00:41:27,266 --> 00:41:29,007
That's who I work for.

676
00:41:29,051 --> 00:41:31,053
And then we get there,
we rig up

677
00:41:31,096 --> 00:41:32,445
and we put
all that shit together.

678
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:35,492
Once we have that rig up,

679
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:37,233
we start making hole.

680
00:41:37,276 --> 00:41:39,017
That's what a roughneck does.

681
00:41:39,061 --> 00:41:40,149
We make hole.

682
00:41:40,192 --> 00:41:42,543
All right, test it.

683
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,371
Go on, flush it.

684
00:41:45,415 --> 00:41:47,069
Get it.

685
00:41:47,112 --> 00:41:48,287
-Flush.
-Ah, flush.

686
00:41:48,331 --> 00:41:50,463
-Yeah.
-D'accord.

687
00:41:50,507 --> 00:41:52,291
-Flush.
-

688
00:41:52,335 --> 00:41:54,598
-CÇa va?
-Hell yeah, ça va!

689
00:41:54,642 --> 00:41:57,906
-

690
00:42:00,082 --> 00:42:01,387
VIRGINIE:
Bill, come.

691
00:42:01,431 --> 00:42:02,563
Come here.

692
00:42:02,606 --> 00:42:04,956
Come and see this.

693
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,610
Nedjma is a technical genius.

694
00:42:06,654 --> 00:42:08,612
I'm not a genius.
I'm just younger.

695
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,486
-Okay...
-These are online or some shit?

696
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:15,401
These are all from
Instagram accounts

697
00:42:15,445 --> 00:42:17,534
of Souad and her bitchy friend.

698
00:42:17,578 --> 00:42:20,145
And these photos
are all from the party.

699
00:42:20,189 --> 00:42:21,451
How'd y'all get them?

700
00:42:21,494 --> 00:42:23,584
I set up
a false Instagram account,

701
00:42:23,627 --> 00:42:26,543
followed Souad and her lovely
friend whose name is Samira,

702
00:42:26,587 --> 00:42:28,110
and then geotagged the party

703
00:42:28,153 --> 00:42:29,938
Souad was at
when she saw this guy.

704
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:33,289
So there's a chance
Akim is in one of these photos.

705
00:42:38,381 --> 00:42:40,296
VIRGINIE:
...Arab and light skin.

706
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:42,080
Yeah, uh, light skin,
yeah, and tall.

707
00:42:48,521 --> 00:42:50,175
So we're going
to print them up,

708
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:52,090
and then you can show them
to Allison.

709
00:42:53,091 --> 00:42:55,398
-No, I'm not gonna do that.
-Why?

710
00:42:55,441 --> 00:42:57,443
If Akim is there, she'll know.

711
00:42:57,487 --> 00:42:59,184
I don't care.

712
00:42:59,228 --> 00:43:01,317
I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not gonna do it to her.

713
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,971
I got to protect her.

714
00:43:03,014 --> 00:43:04,450
I don't understand.

715
00:43:04,494 --> 00:43:07,453
Wh-why you're being
so stubborn about Allison?

716
00:43:07,497 --> 00:43:09,368
What we should do
is go back to Souad

717
00:43:09,412 --> 00:43:10,979
now we got those pictures.

718
00:43:11,022 --> 00:43:13,677
Well, we stole these photos
from Instagram,

719
00:43:13,721 --> 00:43:15,548
so I'm not sure
this is a good idea.

720
00:43:17,289 --> 00:43:19,378
-Well...
-NEDJMA: Can I say something?

721
00:43:19,422 --> 00:43:21,032
Ouais, vas-y.

722
00:43:21,076 --> 00:43:23,469
Did anyone else in Marseille
see this Akim guy

723
00:43:23,513 --> 00:43:25,297
or just Allison?

724
00:43:25,341 --> 00:43:27,082
Bar owner.

725
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:28,300
Where they met.

726
00:43:28,344 --> 00:43:29,780
He was at the trial.

727
00:43:29,824 --> 00:43:31,608
-He didn't do shit, but...
-VIRGINIE: Okay.

728
00:43:31,652 --> 00:43:34,132
Uh, what's it called, the bar?
What's the name?

729
00:43:34,176 --> 00:43:36,004
I don't remember
the name of it.

730
00:43:36,047 --> 00:43:38,659
-It was near her apartment.
-Yeah. Okay.

731
00:43:38,702 --> 00:43:39,747
-Mm.
-Mm.

732
00:43:58,243 --> 00:43:59,375
Okay.

733
00:43:59,418 --> 00:44:01,551
Bill, did you vote for Trump?

734
00:44:02,683 --> 00:44:04,032
No.

735
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:06,512
Ah. Voilà.

736
00:44:06,556 --> 00:44:08,776
-I didn't vote.
-VIRGINIE: What?

737
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:11,648
-Why didn't you vote?
-Got a record.

738
00:44:11,692 --> 00:44:14,172
I was arrested.

739
00:44:14,216 --> 00:44:16,261
They don't let you vote
when that happens.

740
00:44:34,279 --> 00:44:36,629
VIRGINIE:
It's there, around that corner.

741
00:44:38,588 --> 00:44:42,287
Your friend, uh, Nedjma...

742
00:44:42,331 --> 00:44:44,725
she mad at you for helping me?

743
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:47,815
Don't worry about Nedjma;
she's generally hostile.

744
00:44:47,858 --> 00:44:50,252
You know, she's very protective
with me,

745
00:44:50,295 --> 00:44:51,732
but she's a good friend.

746
00:44:51,775 --> 00:44:54,212
She helps me with Maya.

747
00:44:54,256 --> 00:44:56,824
BILL:
Where's Maya's father?

748
00:44:56,867 --> 00:45:00,131
VIRGINIE: Corsica, running
a nightclub on the beach.

749
00:45:00,175 --> 00:45:02,655
He was a... a fling.

750
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:04,570
-That's how you say?
-Fling, yeah.

751
00:45:04,614 --> 00:45:06,268
Yeah.

752
00:45:06,311 --> 00:45:07,791
Does he visit?

753
00:45:07,835 --> 00:45:10,098
He used to, but it's better
when he doesn't.

754
00:45:12,665 --> 00:45:14,232
What?

755
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:17,235
BILL:
That's where Allison lived.

756
00:45:19,498 --> 00:45:20,848
Twenty-one.

757
00:45:21,849 --> 00:45:24,808
That's where it happened?

758
00:45:24,852 --> 00:45:26,418
Yeah.

759
00:45:33,774 --> 00:45:35,645
-Bonjour.
-Bonjour.

760
00:45:48,484 --> 00:45:49,833
He's the new owner.

761
00:45:49,877 --> 00:45:52,444
He wasn't there
when the crime happened.

762
00:45:52,488 --> 00:45:54,490
Does he know where we could
find the old owner?

763
00:45:54,533 --> 00:45:56,622
Yes, I know.

764
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:57,798
He's right there.

765
00:45:57,841 --> 00:45:59,843
Drinking my profits.

766
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:16,425
Euhm...

767
00:46:21,473 --> 00:46:24,346
He recognize anybody?

768
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:41,842
BILL:
What's he saying?

769
00:46:59,947 --> 00:47:01,339
Putain.

770
00:47:01,383 --> 00:47:03,689
Okay. CÇ'est bon.Let's go.

771
00:47:03,733 --> 00:47:04,821
What'd he say?

772
00:47:04,865 --> 00:47:06,388
Nothing. He's useless.

773
00:47:09,608 --> 00:47:10,958
Hey.

774
00:47:14,396 --> 00:47:16,354
Hey!

775
00:47:16,398 --> 00:47:18,617
Hey! What happened?

776
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:20,924
I'm sorry. I just, uh-- I can't
talk to that guy anymore.

777
00:47:20,968 --> 00:47:23,318
He was just saying
some horrible things.

778
00:47:23,361 --> 00:47:24,928
Like what?

779
00:47:24,972 --> 00:47:26,974
Like he just wants to put
an Arab kid in jail, you know?

780
00:47:27,017 --> 00:47:28,801
He doesn't care which one.

781
00:47:28,845 --> 00:47:30,847
That's it?

782
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:33,545
That's it?
What do you mean, "That's it"?

783
00:47:33,589 --> 00:47:34,720
He's a racist.

784
00:47:34,764 --> 00:47:36,418
Okay, he's a racist.

785
00:47:36,461 --> 00:47:37,723
We still got to talk to him.

786
00:47:37,767 --> 00:47:39,725
No. I don't talk to him, no.

787
00:47:39,769 --> 00:47:41,597
Well, he might know something.

788
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,251
No, he doesn't know something!

789
00:47:43,294 --> 00:47:45,514
Bill, we're not gonna send
an innocent boy to jail.

790
00:47:45,557 --> 00:47:47,429
My daughter is innocent.

791
00:47:47,472 --> 00:47:50,258
Quoi? Oh, putain.Can't believe
this conversation.

792
00:47:50,301 --> 00:47:53,391
Well, then y-you live
in some fancy-ass world, honey,

793
00:47:53,435 --> 00:47:55,437
'cause I work with guys
like that all the time.

794
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,395
No, but it doesn't matter, okay?
It's not right.

795
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,831
I'm not saying it's ri...

796
00:47:58,875 --> 00:47:59,920
I'm trying to get
my little girl out of jail.

797
00:47:59,963 --> 00:48:01,399
That's all I give a fuck about.

798
00:48:01,443 --> 00:48:04,054
And you sound
very American right now.

799
00:48:04,098 --> 00:48:06,274
Good. I am.

800
00:48:06,317 --> 00:48:07,666
Yeah, and you're also
a stranger here.

801
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:09,277
You don't understand shit.
You know what?

802
00:48:34,824 --> 00:48:36,652
Mr. Baker, one moment please.

803
00:48:36,695 --> 00:48:38,045
You have a message.

804
00:48:39,089 --> 00:48:41,048
:
She said you need more money

805
00:48:41,091 --> 00:48:43,093
because Leparq
reopened the case?

806
00:48:43,137 --> 00:48:44,877
BILL:
I'm dealing with it, Sharon.

807
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:46,879
-Dealing with what?
-Nothing.

808
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:49,534
I mean, Allison told me
to give her a letter.

809
00:48:49,578 --> 00:48:52,059
I did, and now Leparq's
looking into it.

810
00:48:52,102 --> 00:48:54,626
Well, i-is she looking
for Akim again?

811
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:57,325
I'm-I'm-- I told you
I'm dealing with it, Sharon.

812
00:48:57,368 --> 00:49:00,067
-Who is gonna pay for this?
-Nobody's talking about money.

813
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:01,416
Okay?

814
00:49:01,459 --> 00:49:03,418
Bill, have you been drinking?

815
00:49:03,461 --> 00:49:04,767
No.

816
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:06,073
Listen, Sharon, I'm her father.

817
00:49:06,116 --> 00:49:07,900
Oh, my God, Bill.

818
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:09,815
You're supposed to visit
and come home.

819
00:49:09,859 --> 00:49:11,382
Don't mess with this.

820
00:49:11,426 --> 00:49:12,993
Y-You're gonna need
to trust me on this.

821
00:49:13,036 --> 00:49:14,559
That's it.

822
00:49:14,603 --> 00:49:15,952
I'm gonna call Leparq.

823
00:49:15,996 --> 00:49:17,606
No, don't do that, Sharon.

824
00:49:17,649 --> 00:49:18,824
-Sharon!
-

825
00:49:23,742 --> 00:49:26,484
-

826
00:49:31,924 --> 00:49:33,796
Dad, what is going on?

827
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,667
I talked to Gram, she said that
you're acting really weird.

828
00:49:35,711 --> 00:49:37,495
All right, I just need you
to trust me, all right?

829
00:49:37,539 --> 00:49:40,063
I need you to look
at these pictures.

830
00:49:40,107 --> 00:49:41,717
ALLISON:
Dad?

831
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,675
Dad...

832
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:44,937
are you drinking?

833
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:47,636
What? No, never.

834
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:49,072
Are you using?

835
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:51,509
Ally, I'm done with that shit.
You know that.

836
00:49:51,553 --> 00:49:52,902
Now, come on,
look at these pictures.

837
00:49:52,945 --> 00:49:54,860
Wh-What the fuck are these?!
Where's Leparq?!

838
00:49:54,904 --> 00:49:56,514
-Wh-Why isn't she here?!
-Just look at the photos

839
00:49:56,558 --> 00:49:58,647
and tell me if you see Akim!

840
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:02,042
I think he's in there.

841
00:50:03,521 --> 00:50:05,088
Please, baby.

842
00:50:05,132 --> 00:50:07,525
Please.

843
00:50:09,092 --> 00:50:10,833
Please.

844
00:50:19,668 --> 00:50:22,714
-No, I don't see him.
-Okay, all right. There's more.

845
00:50:22,758 --> 00:50:24,586
There's more.

846
00:50:36,728 --> 00:50:38,034
Holy shit.

847
00:50:39,775 --> 00:50:40,906
Holy shit.

848
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:42,082
You see him? Which one?

849
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:44,127
That's him.

850
00:50:44,171 --> 00:50:45,824
That's him. That's Akim.

851
00:50:45,868 --> 00:50:48,566
You're sure?
That's the guy from that night?

852
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:51,482
Daddy, that's him.

853
00:50:55,878 --> 00:50:57,619
Kalliste?

854
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,971
Yeah. Uh, oui.In there.

855
00:51:02,014 --> 00:51:03,886
Just drive on in.

856
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:13,939
Thank you.

857
00:51:27,823 --> 00:51:29,259
Excuse me, ma'am.

Akim?

860
00:51:32,697 --> 00:51:34,177
-Non. Non.
-He lives, he lives here. No?

861
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:37,920
Ma'am, have you
seen him before? Akim?

862
00:51:41,967 --> 00:51:43,186
Excuse me, sir.

863
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:45,580
-You seen that guy before?
-Non.

864
00:51:45,623 --> 00:51:47,625
BILL: How about you?
Have you seen this guy before?

865
00:51:47,669 --> 00:51:48,844
WOMAN:
Nan.

866
00:51:53,544 --> 00:51:56,199
-Looking for him. Akim.
-No.

867
00:51:56,243 --> 00:51:58,201
You know him? Akim?

868
00:51:58,245 --> 00:51:59,811
Non.

869
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:11,171

BILL:
You ever seen that guy?

873
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:31,539
Akim?

874
00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:33,018
Non, non. Non, non, non.

875
00:52:33,062 --> 00:52:34,324
-This guy?

876
00:52:34,368 --> 00:52:35,325
No?

877
00:52:52,734 --> 00:52:54,692
Hey. You know that guy?

878
00:52:54,736 --> 00:52:56,651
-Right there? Akim?
-

879
00:52:56,694 --> 00:52:58,218
You know him?

880
00:52:58,261 --> 00:52:59,958
-This guy, Akim, he lives here?
-

881
00:53:00,002 --> 00:53:01,699
Yeah.

882
00:53:03,266 --> 00:53:04,789
How about... Akim?

883
00:53:04,833 --> 00:53:06,226
-Non, non.

884
00:53:07,314 --> 00:53:08,793
MAN:
Bye-bye, cowboy.

885
00:53:25,027 --> 00:53:26,985
-

886
00:53:41,086 --> 00:53:42,087
You speak English?

887
00:53:44,133 --> 00:53:46,788
Hey, you know this guy?
This-- His name's Akim.

888
00:53:46,831 --> 00:53:48,398
He li-- he lives here.

889
00:53:48,442 --> 00:53:49,921
Akim?

890
00:53:49,965 --> 00:53:51,358
-The guy lives here.

891
00:53:58,147 --> 00:54:00,628
I-I speak English.
You suck my dick.

892
00:55:18,401 --> 00:55:19,924
MAN:
Allez!

893
00:55:32,241 --> 00:55:34,243
-Ici.
-Merci.

894
00:55:37,812 --> 00:55:39,204
Hi.

895
00:55:41,816 --> 00:55:43,905
They asked me
if I knew anybody.

896
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:46,386
Are you okay?

897
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:49,737
I saw him.

898
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,303
I saw Akim.

899
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:53,480
In Kalliste.

900
00:55:53,523 --> 00:55:55,264
Did you tell the police?

901
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:04,099
That was my chance.

902
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:08,364
That was my chance.

903
00:56:44,531 --> 00:56:46,358
What the fuck did you do?

904
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:48,360
I was trying to help.

905
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:50,537
Tell me exactly
what you did, Dad.

906
00:56:52,147 --> 00:56:53,365
Dad.

907
00:56:54,497 --> 00:56:56,499
She wouldn't do it, Ally.

908
00:56:56,543 --> 00:56:58,893
Leparq wouldn't
look into the case.

909
00:57:01,635 --> 00:57:03,375
:
Oh, my God.

910
00:57:04,376 --> 00:57:06,422
You fucking lied.

911
00:57:07,641 --> 00:57:09,338
About all of it.

912
00:57:09,381 --> 00:57:11,166
Of course you did.

913
00:57:11,209 --> 00:57:13,951
I found him, Ally.

914
00:57:13,995 --> 00:57:15,387
I found Akim.

915
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:18,956
And why didn't you
call the police?

916
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,262
Why?!

917
00:57:21,263 --> 00:57:22,830
Why?!

918
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:25,528
You let him get away!

919
00:57:25,572 --> 00:57:27,399
-He's fucking gone now!
-

920
00:57:27,443 --> 00:57:29,489
He's fucking gone!

921
00:57:30,533 --> 00:57:33,841
I feel so stupid.
I feel so stupid.

922
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:38,236
You've always lied to me,
my entire life, always!

923
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:41,283
I hate myself
for ever trusting you!

924
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:49,509
-Ally, listen to me.
-No!

925
00:57:49,552 --> 00:57:51,554
No! No.

926
00:57:53,338 --> 00:57:56,864
You are done
fucking up my life.

927
00:57:57,647 --> 00:57:59,519
Do you get that?

928
00:58:00,607 --> 00:58:03,348
Do you?

929
00:58:03,392 --> 00:58:05,960
Stay the fuck away from me.

930
00:58:24,587 --> 00:58:27,285
MAN:
Bill! Bill!

931
00:58:31,681 --> 00:58:33,901
-Hey, guys.
-

932
00:58:44,172 --> 00:58:46,130
Hé, Bill.

933
00:58:46,174 --> 00:58:48,568
-Yeah, I got it.

934
00:59:02,538 --> 00:59:05,280
the TV screen

935
00:59:13,462 --> 00:59:16,683
just like a loaded gun

936
00:59:16,726 --> 00:59:21,122
I'm six feet underground...

937
00:59:34,439 --> 00:59:36,398
-Hé, Bill.
-How we doing?

938
00:59:36,441 --> 00:59:37,617
How was school today? Good?

939
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:39,183
-You get it done?
-

940
00:59:39,227 --> 00:59:40,489
All right, come on. Let's go.

941
00:59:40,532 --> 00:59:42,186
-Yeah, I got it.

942
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:44,188
-Here. I got you that.
-

943
00:59:46,538 --> 00:59:49,019
Maya, you got to eat
the whole thing.

944
00:59:51,413 --> 00:59:52,980
I see what you're doing,

945
00:59:53,023 --> 00:59:55,243
but you got to eat
the bread part, too.

946
01:00:00,335 --> 01:00:02,119
Oh, you gonna
pawn it off on me?

947
01:00:02,163 --> 01:00:03,425
All right.

948
01:00:08,517 --> 01:00:10,040
Bill.

949
01:00:11,172 --> 01:00:13,522
Uh... un marteau.

950
01:00:13,565 --> 01:00:15,437
Oui. Très bien. Marteau.

951
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,526
-Hammer.
-Hammer.

952
01:00:19,789 --> 01:00:22,444
Uh... ciseau...

953
01:00:22,487 --> 01:00:24,489
Uh... ciseausomething.

954
01:00:24,533 --> 01:00:26,796
-Ciseau à bois.
-Ciseau à bois.

955
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,494
That's a shitload of words
for "chisel."

956
01:00:29,538 --> 01:00:31,583
-Chisel.
-Come on in. Get the light.

957
01:00:32,715 --> 01:00:35,413
-Lumière.
-Lumière.

958
01:00:35,457 --> 01:00:37,502
-

959
01:00:44,118 --> 01:00:45,641
Maya, supper.

960
01:00:47,469 --> 01:00:48,688
Maya.

961
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:53,431
That bald guy's
gonna lose his shirt.

962
01:00:59,742 --> 01:01:00,787
-Oh, non.
-

963
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:02,310
Yeah, that's how they do it.

964
01:01:02,353 --> 01:01:05,487
Cut to commercial
before the big reveal.

965
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:07,228
Come on, let's eat.

966
01:01:07,271 --> 01:01:09,317
-Come on.
-

967
01:01:11,754 --> 01:01:13,800
You do your homework?

968
01:01:13,843 --> 01:01:16,498
-Homework?
-Ah, non.

969
01:01:16,541 --> 01:01:18,369
Well, appreciate the honesty.

970
01:01:18,413 --> 01:01:20,371
Yeah, I used to
hate school, too.

971
01:01:20,415 --> 01:01:22,199
Hated everything about it.

972
01:01:22,243 --> 01:01:25,725
Dropped out of high school,
worked a rig like my daddy,

973
01:01:25,768 --> 01:01:27,335
started making hole.

974
01:01:27,378 --> 01:01:29,772
That what you gonna do?
You gonna make hole?

975
01:01:29,816 --> 01:01:32,644
-Oui,I make hole.
-: No shit.

976
01:01:32,688 --> 01:01:34,472
You got to start out a worm,
you know.

977
01:01:34,516 --> 01:01:36,866
That's the lowest of the low.
A worm.

978
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:38,738
Non, pas unworm.

979
01:01:38,781 --> 01:01:40,652
Je veux travailler
sur le derrick,like you.

980
01:01:40,696 --> 01:01:42,176
You going right to the derrick?

981
01:01:42,219 --> 01:01:44,352
You got to have the want-to.

982
01:01:44,395 --> 01:01:45,875
You got the want-to?

983
01:01:45,919 --> 01:01:48,182
Ben, oui.

984
01:01:48,225 --> 01:01:49,618
Hey.

985
01:01:52,795 --> 01:01:54,884
-Thank you, Lord, for this and
other blessings. -

986
01:01:54,928 --> 01:01:56,277
-Please look after Ally.
-

987
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:57,321
Keep a close eye on her.

988
01:01:57,365 --> 01:01:59,454
We ask this in Jesus' name.

989
01:01:59,497 --> 01:02:00,629
Amen.

990
01:02:00,672 --> 01:02:02,152
-Dig in.
-Dig in.

991
01:02:02,196 --> 01:02:03,763
-VIRGINIE: Bonsoir.
-Bonsoir, maman.

992
01:02:03,806 --> 01:02:05,329
-Hey.
-BILL: Hey.

993
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:14,556
-There's a burger up there
if you want it. -Thanks. Ah.

994
01:02:14,599 --> 01:02:15,731
For me?

995
01:02:15,775 --> 01:02:17,124
Yes, ma'am.

996
01:02:17,167 --> 01:02:18,473
-That's rent.
-Thank you.

997
01:02:20,867 --> 01:02:23,652
Would you please
get me the ketchup?

998
01:02:27,699 --> 01:02:29,266
MAYA:
Non.

999
01:02:30,877 --> 01:02:32,748
-Mais oui.
-BILL: Thank you.

1000
01:02:32,792 --> 01:02:34,924
Bill, she has to do
her homework.

1001
01:02:34,968 --> 01:02:38,188
I know. Hundred percent.

1002
01:02:38,232 --> 01:02:39,450
Do your homework.

1003
01:02:41,539 --> 01:02:43,411
-Yeah?
-Mm.

1004
01:02:43,454 --> 01:02:45,369
Merci.

1005
01:02:45,413 --> 01:02:48,372
When I see what you guys eat, I
understand why you pray before.

1006
01:02:49,721 --> 01:02:52,724
-How was play practice?
-Rehearsal.

1007
01:02:52,768 --> 01:02:55,336
Uh, it was shit.

1008
01:02:55,379 --> 01:02:58,339
We do a lot of stage writing,
so it's messy,

1009
01:02:58,382 --> 01:03:02,386
and, uh, the-the director--
he's young and provincial.

1010
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:04,519
What's stage writing?

1011
01:03:04,562 --> 01:03:08,349
We don't know what we're doing,
so we make it up instead.

1012
01:03:08,392 --> 01:03:09,654
Cool.

1013
01:03:09,698 --> 01:03:11,874
Cool Raoul.

1014
01:03:14,442 --> 01:03:16,313
Drops back,
scrambles to the middle.

1015
01:03:16,357 --> 01:03:19,490
Down inside the ten,
so the clock is running,

1016
01:03:19,534 --> 01:03:20,840
-clock is running.

1017
01:03:22,711 --> 01:03:24,495
BILL:
Back to bed.

1018
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:25,975
I look with you?

1019
01:03:26,019 --> 01:03:28,412
No way.

1020
01:03:28,456 --> 01:03:29,587
Bed.

1021
01:03:29,631 --> 01:03:31,676
You're gonna get me in trouble.

1022
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:32,939
My tablet.

1023
01:03:32,982 --> 01:03:34,897
Yeah, I'm using it.

1024
01:03:34,941 --> 01:03:36,420
Bed, now.

1025
01:03:41,861 --> 01:03:43,601
SPORTSCASTER: ...fourth
quarter. Well, why not?

1026
01:03:43,645 --> 01:03:45,690
-

1027
01:04:00,705 --> 01:04:02,229
Hello?

1028
01:04:03,317 --> 01:04:04,579
Yeah, this is him.

1029
01:04:06,407 --> 01:04:08,235
LEPARQ:
It's a one-day leave.

1030
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:09,714
She goes out in the morning,

1031
01:04:09,758 --> 01:04:11,499
comes back to the prison
at night.

1032
01:04:11,542 --> 01:04:12,892
Then if it goes well,

1033
01:04:12,935 --> 01:04:14,981
she'll get another day
the following month.

1034
01:04:15,024 --> 01:04:17,026
The idea is for inmates
to acclimate

1035
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:18,898
to the outside world again.

1036
01:04:18,941 --> 01:04:20,334
Understand?

1037
01:04:20,377 --> 01:04:21,639
Yes, ma'am, I do.

1038
01:04:21,683 --> 01:04:25,252
The judge requires a chaperone,

1039
01:04:25,295 --> 01:04:27,689
someone who is
going to vouch for her.

1040
01:04:28,951 --> 01:04:30,692
Did she ask for me?

1041
01:04:31,736 --> 01:04:32,912
No.

1042
01:04:32,955 --> 01:04:35,915
But you are the only option.

1043
01:04:35,958 --> 01:04:37,917
Okay.
A-Allison hasn't talked to me

1044
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:39,614
for more than four months.

1045
01:04:40,615 --> 01:04:42,008
I am aware.

1046
01:04:43,705 --> 01:04:45,402
:
Mr. Baker,

1047
01:04:45,446 --> 01:04:47,578
do not take any initiative
this time.

1048
01:04:47,622 --> 01:04:49,841
Understand?

1049
01:04:49,885 --> 01:04:51,974
Yes, ma'am, I do.

1050
01:05:35,539 --> 01:05:36,801
Huh?

1051
01:05:36,845 --> 01:05:38,803
Color she love.

1052
01:05:38,847 --> 01:05:40,414
Oh, her favorite color?

1053
01:05:40,457 --> 01:05:41,502
Ah, oui,"favorite."

1054
01:05:41,545 --> 01:05:42,807
Yeah, not sure.

1055
01:05:48,683 --> 01:05:50,032
Hey, Maya?

1056
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,687
No.

1057
01:05:55,603 --> 01:05:57,474
I thought it was pretty.

1058
01:05:57,518 --> 01:05:58,867
Bill! Bill!

1059
01:06:04,046 --> 01:06:06,527
Ah, soccer, no.
Allison likes Oklahoma State.

1060
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:08,398
She likes real football.

1061
01:06:08,442 --> 01:06:09,878
This is football,
favorite foot.

1062
01:06:09,921 --> 01:06:11,967
No, these guys
are a bunch of babies.

1063
01:06:12,011 --> 01:06:13,360
Bunch of crybabies.

1064
01:06:18,669 --> 01:06:20,889
All right, all right, don't
get all wound up. How much?

1065
01:06:26,112 --> 01:06:27,722
Maman.

1066
01:06:33,075 --> 01:06:34,598
Euh, non.

1067
01:06:34,642 --> 01:06:35,991
Merci, Bill.

1068
01:06:36,035 --> 01:06:38,385
-All right.
-VIRGINIE: Merci, Bill.

1069
01:06:39,647 --> 01:06:40,996
-Oui.
-Bonjour, Maya.

1070
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:43,085
Bonjour.

1071
01:06:43,129 --> 01:06:45,087
Hi. You must be Bill.

1072
01:06:45,131 --> 01:06:46,480
Yes, sir. Hi.

1073
01:06:46,523 --> 01:06:48,438
Good to meet you.

1074
01:06:48,482 --> 01:06:52,399
Uh, Virginie told me
you-you are from Oklahoma.

1075
01:06:52,442 --> 01:06:53,748
That's so cool.

1076
01:06:55,141 --> 01:06:56,577
Okay.

1077
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:59,188
Renaud is
a rising star director.

1078
01:06:59,232 --> 01:07:00,885
That's me.

1079
01:07:00,929 --> 01:07:02,931
Oh, you're the one
who does the stage writing?

1080
01:07:02,974 --> 01:07:05,542
Yeah. You know about
stage writing?

1081
01:07:05,586 --> 01:07:07,066
Great.

1082
01:07:07,109 --> 01:07:09,938
Y-You know, man, I really love
working like this.

1083
01:07:09,981 --> 01:07:11,070
It's real, you know?

1084
01:07:11,113 --> 01:07:14,682
Stage writing? It's truth.

1085
01:07:14,725 --> 01:07:16,727
It's from life.

1086
01:07:17,946 --> 01:07:19,556
Virginie been telling me
about it, right?

1087
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,602
Yeah. Merci, Bill.

1088
01:07:21,645 --> 01:07:23,821
Um, would you help me
move the table?

1089
01:07:23,865 --> 01:07:25,562
-'Cause dinner is...
-Yeah, I got it.

1090
01:07:25,606 --> 01:07:27,086
Merci, Bill.

1091
01:07:27,129 --> 01:07:29,914
RENAUD: Seriously, for me,
it makes total sense.

1092
01:07:29,958 --> 01:07:31,612
People should be able
to carry guns.

1093
01:07:33,179 --> 01:07:34,136
You know, but they got freedom.

1094
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:35,746
It's basic freedom.

1095
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:37,618
-I would love to have a gun.
-

1096
01:07:40,534 --> 01:07:42,013
I'm sure you have a gun.

1097
01:07:42,057 --> 01:07:44,233
-Don't you, Bill?
-Yes, sir, I do.

1098
01:07:44,277 --> 01:07:47,106
-Yes!
-No, you do not.

1099
01:07:47,149 --> 01:07:49,108
Why wouldn't I?
I got two of them.

1100
01:07:49,151 --> 01:07:51,153
I got a shotgun and a Glock.

1101
01:07:51,197 --> 01:07:53,547
-Oh, non, putain. C'est pas
vrai.-Two guns! It's perfect!

1102
01:07:53,590 --> 01:07:55,853
Non, non. Arrête, arrte.
It's okay. It's okay.

1103
01:07:55,897 --> 01:07:57,246
It's-it's his...

1104
01:07:57,290 --> 01:07:59,553
-His-his... his culture.
-: Culture.

1105
01:07:59,596 --> 01:08:01,207
Culture is
such a broad concept, huh?

1106
01:08:02,991 --> 01:08:04,688
I'm gonna call it
a night, y'all.

1107
01:08:04,732 --> 01:08:06,516
Come on, Bill. It's early.

1108
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:08,692
-I'll put Maya to bed.
-Oh, I can do it.

1109
01:08:08,736 --> 01:08:10,781
-I got it.
-Okay.

1110
01:08:15,003 --> 01:08:17,179
You're my favorite.

1111
01:08:19,007 --> 01:08:20,487
Favorite what?

1112
01:08:21,314 --> 01:08:24,099
Favorite American.

1113
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:31,106
Sweet dreams, little girl.

1114
01:08:59,874 --> 01:09:02,137
VIRGINIE: You know
it's Sunday morning, right?

1115
01:09:02,181 --> 01:09:03,660
BILL:
Where's your friend?

1116
01:09:04,705 --> 01:09:07,229
Oh, he left early this morning.

1117
01:09:07,273 --> 01:09:09,013
Mm.

1118
01:09:09,057 --> 01:09:11,015
We had a bit too much to drink.

1119
01:09:11,059 --> 01:09:12,843
Ain't no shit.

1120
01:09:16,325 --> 01:09:21,243
I was thinking, uh, I'd like
to bring Allison by the house.

1121
01:09:22,288 --> 01:09:24,812
Won't it be too much for her?

1122
01:09:24,855 --> 01:09:27,206
I'd like her to see
where I live.

1123
01:09:28,294 --> 01:09:29,991
If you're okay with it.

1124
01:09:30,034 --> 01:09:32,080
Why wouldn't I be?

1125
01:09:33,255 --> 01:09:35,257
Not everybody is.

1126
01:09:54,624 --> 01:09:57,192
-Hey.
-Hey.

1127
01:09:59,325 --> 01:10:00,891
This your van?

1128
01:10:00,935 --> 01:10:02,893
From work.

1129
01:10:02,937 --> 01:10:04,808
What work?

1130
01:10:04,852 --> 01:10:06,201
Construction.

1131
01:10:06,245 --> 01:10:08,290
I told you about it
in my letters.

1132
01:10:08,334 --> 01:10:09,596
You didn't get them?

1133
01:10:09,639 --> 01:10:11,337
I did.

1134
01:10:12,947 --> 01:10:14,253
I didn't read them.

1135
01:10:16,907 --> 01:10:18,953
-You want to get going?
-Yeah.

1136
01:10:30,312 --> 01:10:31,879
Merci.

1137
01:11:17,881 --> 01:11:19,927
Life is brutal.

1138
01:11:27,151 --> 01:11:29,023
Can I drive?

1139
01:11:36,813 --> 01:11:40,164
by brothers

1140
01:11:44,473 --> 01:11:45,996
ALLISON: I haven't heard
this song in a while.

1141
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:47,868
BILL:
Special playlist for today.

1142
01:11:49,217 --> 01:11:52,002
How old is that thing?

1143
01:11:52,046 --> 01:11:53,482
It still works.

1144
01:11:53,526 --> 01:11:57,138
foggy feeling when I'm...

1145
01:11:57,181 --> 01:11:59,227
So you never went home?

1146
01:12:00,228 --> 01:12:02,012
Nope.

1147
01:12:02,056 --> 01:12:04,058
How come?

1148
01:12:04,101 --> 01:12:07,017
to keep believing

1149
01:12:09,411 --> 01:12:15,243
beats your hope in the ground

1150
01:12:15,286 --> 01:12:20,248
it's really coming down

1151
01:12:20,291 --> 01:12:22,206
I'm...
-

1152
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:24,208
Are you sure we can park here?

1153
01:12:24,252 --> 01:12:25,949
What are they gonna do?

1154
01:12:25,993 --> 01:12:27,734
Arrest me?

1155
01:14:10,227 --> 01:14:11,838
O.M.

1156
01:14:11,881 --> 01:14:13,970
You really are a local now.

1157
01:14:14,014 --> 01:14:15,363
Maya sold me on it.

1158
01:14:15,406 --> 01:14:17,104
That's her favorite team.

1159
01:14:18,148 --> 01:14:19,585
Does this kid have a father?

1160
01:14:19,628 --> 01:14:21,935
He's not around.

1161
01:14:21,978 --> 01:14:23,937
Lives on a beach or some shit.

1162
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:25,852
Groovy.

1163
01:14:28,463 --> 01:14:30,291
So is this woman
your girlfriend?

1164
01:14:30,334 --> 01:14:31,901
It's not like that.

1165
01:14:31,945 --> 01:14:33,990
I just live with them.

1166
01:14:34,034 --> 01:14:35,514
Like roommates.

1167
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:38,473
What does she do?

1168
01:14:39,605 --> 01:14:41,998
She's sort of an actress.

1169
01:14:42,042 --> 01:14:43,565
Sort of an actress?

1170
01:14:45,393 --> 01:14:46,873
She a stripper?

1171
01:14:46,916 --> 01:14:48,309
No.

1172
01:14:50,354 --> 01:14:52,313
She just don't do
TV acting or anything.

1173
01:14:52,356 --> 01:14:54,576
She does theater.

1174
01:14:55,621 --> 01:14:57,187
Theater.

1175
01:14:58,928 --> 01:15:01,278
Have you seen her act?

1176
01:15:01,322 --> 01:15:04,891
What am I gonna do
in a fucking theater?

1177
01:15:06,588 --> 01:15:08,111
Yeah.

1178
01:15:16,206 --> 01:15:18,252
You know what's messed-up?

1179
01:15:20,123 --> 01:15:22,561
I never had a chance
to mourn her.

1180
01:15:22,604 --> 01:15:24,127
Lina.

1181
01:15:27,348 --> 01:15:30,220
It was so intense
when we first met.

1182
01:15:32,179 --> 01:15:34,094
She was so funny.

1183
01:15:35,182 --> 01:15:37,576
And cool and beautiful.

1184
01:15:42,015 --> 01:15:44,234
Then she moved in,
and everything got fucked-up.

1185
01:15:45,758 --> 01:15:48,543
She started sleeping
with other people.

1186
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:52,286
Like it didn't matter.

1187
01:15:55,463 --> 01:15:58,379
Like she was just using me.

1188
01:15:59,467 --> 01:16:01,164
Or something.

1189
01:16:05,125 --> 01:16:08,215
:
And I felt so humiliated.

1190
01:16:11,087 --> 01:16:13,481
But, you know, the really
fucked-up thing is...

1191
01:16:15,526 --> 01:16:17,572
...I just want to see her.

1192
01:16:20,488 --> 01:16:22,533
I just want to be with her.

1193
01:16:25,014 --> 01:16:26,407
So much.

1194
01:16:31,586 --> 01:16:33,544
VIRGINIE:
Oui.

1195
01:16:33,588 --> 01:16:35,677
Ouais.

1196
01:16:37,418 --> 01:16:38,680
-

1197
01:16:38,724 --> 01:16:39,638
-

1198
01:16:45,687 --> 01:16:48,734
-Bonjour. -Bonjour.
-BILL: This is Allison.

1199
01:16:48,777 --> 01:16:50,387
Thanks, Dad.
I think she knew that.

1200
01:16:50,431 --> 01:16:52,651
:
I'm Virginie.

1201
01:16:52,694 --> 01:16:54,348
I'm Allison.

1202
01:16:54,391 --> 01:16:55,566
-Enchantée.
-Enchantée.

1203
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:58,004
-Come. Come in.
-Merci.

1204
01:16:59,658 --> 01:17:02,182
Maya? Maya?

1205
01:17:03,662 --> 01:17:04,750
BILL:
Get out here.

1206
01:17:04,793 --> 01:17:07,317
Wait. Attends.

1207
01:17:20,809 --> 01:17:22,115
Ouais.

1208
01:17:26,685 --> 01:17:28,034
MAYA:
Oui.

1209
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:43,702
Ouais.

1210
01:18:06,115 --> 01:18:07,290
Oui.

1211
01:18:13,688 --> 01:18:15,298
:
Hey, y'all.

1212
01:18:21,217 --> 01:18:22,828
-Ah, watch out. It's hot.
It's hot. -Ow, that's...

1213
01:18:22,871 --> 01:18:25,439
-Yeah. Well, then take this.
-I got it.

1214
01:18:25,482 --> 01:18:28,268
I got it. I got it. I got it.

1215
01:18:35,492 --> 01:18:36,493
Let's pray.

1216
01:18:38,321 --> 01:18:40,106
Thank you, Lord, for this
and many other blessings.

1217
01:18:40,149 --> 01:18:42,369
Thank you for this special day
with Ally.

1218
01:18:42,412 --> 01:18:45,502
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

1219
01:18:45,546 --> 01:18:46,547
Maya?

1220
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:48,418
Dig in.

1221
01:18:51,726 --> 01:18:53,815
-There you go.
-Merci.

1222
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:56,426
Thank you.

1223
01:18:58,689 --> 01:19:00,735
So you two
really aren't having sex?

1224
01:19:01,954 --> 01:19:03,390
Allison Baker.

1225
01:19:03,433 --> 01:19:05,131
What?

1226
01:19:05,174 --> 01:19:06,915
You're so French now,
I-I thought it was okay

1227
01:19:06,959 --> 01:19:09,396
to talk about sex
at the dinner table.

1228
01:19:09,439 --> 01:19:10,789
Sorry.

1229
01:19:11,877 --> 01:19:13,487
Is it okay?

1230
01:19:13,530 --> 01:19:14,749
The food.

1231
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:17,360
It's honestly
the best meal I've had

1232
01:19:17,404 --> 01:19:19,188
in a really long time.

1233
01:19:19,232 --> 01:19:20,624
Good.

1234
01:19:21,756 --> 01:19:23,453
And, no, we don't have sex.

1235
01:19:23,497 --> 01:19:24,803
Jesus.

1236
01:19:26,761 --> 01:19:28,154
VIRGINIE:
Oui.

1237
01:19:31,853 --> 01:19:34,203
So where did you
have lunch today?

1238
01:19:34,247 --> 01:19:36,727
-Pizza.
-Pizza?

1239
01:19:36,771 --> 01:19:39,643
-Chez Sauveur.
It's my favorite place. -Oh.

1240
01:19:39,687 --> 01:19:41,689
-It's so good.

1241
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:46,825
And, uh, I'm curious, why did
you come to Marseille to study?

1242
01:19:47,956 --> 01:19:49,349
It was far away.

1243
01:19:51,003 --> 01:19:52,874
And completely different.

1244
01:19:55,224 --> 01:19:56,443
And the pizza.

1245
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:02,405
-I like it, too.

1246
01:20:17,246 --> 01:20:18,857
BILL:
Uh, oh, no.

1247
01:21:31,016 --> 01:21:32,931
He's a fuckup.

1248
01:21:32,974 --> 01:21:34,976
Always has been.

1249
01:22:20,804 --> 01:22:23,720
It's more beautiful
on this side of the wall.

1250
01:22:29,378 --> 01:22:30,901
I like them.

1251
01:22:30,945 --> 01:22:32,512
Virginie and Maya.

1252
01:22:32,555 --> 01:22:34,775
It's good what you have.

1253
01:22:34,818 --> 01:22:36,995
I'm just trying to do it right.

1254
01:22:37,996 --> 01:22:40,041
I'm happy for you, Dad.

1255
01:22:53,098 --> 01:22:54,403
-WOMAN: Bonsoir.
-Bonsoir.

1256
01:23:00,975 --> 01:23:02,542
:
Hey.

1257
01:23:05,632 --> 01:23:07,025
How are you doing?

1258
01:23:08,678 --> 01:23:09,853
Pretty good.

1259
01:23:09,897 --> 01:23:11,681
Yeah?

1260
01:23:11,725 --> 01:23:13,031
The day was nice?

1261
01:23:14,032 --> 01:23:15,729
Flew by.

1262
01:23:20,734 --> 01:23:22,040
Merci.

1263
01:23:23,432 --> 01:23:24,912
Pourquoi?

1264
01:23:26,087 --> 01:23:28,133
Everything, I guess.

1265
01:23:32,137 --> 01:23:34,704
Oh. Bonne nuit.

1266
01:23:34,748 --> 01:23:36,054
Good night.

1267
01:23:49,850 --> 01:23:51,895
Hello?

1268
01:23:57,988 --> 01:23:59,729
Excuse me.

1269
01:23:59,773 --> 01:24:02,515
I'm Bill Baker, father of
Allison Baker, from Baumettes.

1270
01:24:18,226 --> 01:24:20,576
What happened to her?

1271
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:23,623
What does that mean?

1272
01:24:46,124 --> 01:24:47,821
Fuck off me.

1273
01:25:08,668 --> 01:25:12,106
: I don't leave you,
you don't leave me.

1274
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:14,978
I don't leave you,
you don't leave me.

1275
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:21,985
Is she okay?

1276
01:25:22,029 --> 01:25:23,770
She's stable.

1277
01:26:00,241 --> 01:26:02,112
Hey, Bill.

1278
01:26:05,899 --> 01:26:07,683
BILL:
I talked to Sharon again,

1279
01:26:07,727 --> 01:26:10,077
told her you was back in here.

1280
01:26:11,078 --> 01:26:13,036
And work's been going good.

1281
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:16,126
Uh... good group of guys.

1282
01:26:51,727 --> 01:26:54,817
16, 17,

1283
01:26:54,861 --> 01:26:57,733
18, 16...

1284
01:26:57,777 --> 01:26:59,257
Ah, Bill.

1285
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:00,780
What, did I mess it up?

1286
01:27:00,823 --> 01:27:02,347
Oui,you messed it up.

1287
01:27:07,308 --> 01:27:08,788
"Love at first sight.

1288
01:27:08,831 --> 01:27:11,094
I was trapped by
how you looked at me."

1289
01:27:11,138 --> 01:27:12,922
Lumière.

1290
01:27:12,966 --> 01:27:14,663
Light.

1291
01:27:18,754 --> 01:27:20,800
Casquette.

1292
01:27:20,843 --> 01:27:22,323
Cap.

1293
01:27:22,367 --> 01:27:24,325
-Glasses.

1294
01:27:24,369 --> 01:27:26,066
Lunettes.

1295
01:27:27,067 --> 01:27:28,634
Merci,hand.

1296
01:27:35,815 --> 01:27:37,295
VIRGINIE:
Mathilde...

1297
01:28:12,025 --> 01:28:13,200
Ah. Merci.

1298
01:28:16,290 --> 01:28:18,074
VIRGINIE:
So, what did you think?

1299
01:28:18,118 --> 01:28:19,815
What'd I think?

1300
01:28:19,859 --> 01:28:22,165
Yeah. Of the play.
What did you think?

1301
01:28:22,209 --> 01:28:24,429
Oh, it was good, yeah.

1302
01:28:24,472 --> 01:28:26,692
Yeah? What was good?

1303
01:28:28,041 --> 01:28:29,434
Well...

1304
01:28:31,044 --> 01:28:33,394
I don't fucking know.
I don't know shit about plays.

1305
01:28:33,438 --> 01:28:37,006
-Plus, it's all in French.
-Oh, come on, Bill. One thing.

1306
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:41,359
Uh, no one stands
like real people.

1307
01:28:41,402 --> 01:28:43,839
: What?
-It just looks weird.

1308
01:28:43,883 --> 01:28:45,363
Look, it's great, I'm sure.

1309
01:28:45,406 --> 01:28:46,973
I don't-- D-Don't-don't ask me.

1310
01:28:47,016 --> 01:28:48,366
-I'm a dumbass.
-No, you're not.

1311
01:28:48,409 --> 01:28:51,760
And, no, it's not great, no.

1312
01:28:52,892 --> 01:28:54,067
Ah, merci.

1313
01:28:56,461 --> 01:28:58,376
Cheers.

1314
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:01,901
I will say, you were...

1315
01:29:01,944 --> 01:29:03,293
really good.

1316
01:29:03,337 --> 01:29:04,817
Best thing up there.

1317
01:29:08,168 --> 01:29:11,214
So, I got exciting news.

1318
01:29:12,477 --> 01:29:14,043
I got the part.

1319
01:29:14,087 --> 01:29:16,002
-On the TV show?
-Mm-hmm.

1320
01:29:16,045 --> 01:29:17,917
-Yeah, and I said I'd do it.
-No shit.

1321
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:19,484
-That's great.
-Yeah.

1322
01:29:19,527 --> 01:29:21,964
But...

1323
01:29:22,008 --> 01:29:24,358
it's more money,
but it's also more hours,

1324
01:29:24,402 --> 01:29:27,056
so that means I'll have to pay
for a babysitter

1325
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:28,884
and I'll be away more
from Maya.

1326
01:29:28,928 --> 01:29:31,234
Well, I could help
with Maya, too.

1327
01:29:31,278 --> 01:29:32,453
No, you help enough, you know?

1328
01:29:32,497 --> 01:29:33,976
You got a job. You're busy.

1329
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:36,805
I don't care. I want to.

1330
01:29:40,330 --> 01:29:41,810
Why?

1331
01:29:42,811 --> 01:29:44,030
-Why?
-Mm.

1332
01:29:45,379 --> 01:29:47,947
I like spending time with her.

1333
01:29:48,948 --> 01:29:50,428
And with me, too?

1334
01:29:52,342 --> 01:29:53,996
Yeah.

1335
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:55,302
And you, too.

1336
01:29:56,869 --> 01:29:59,045
How much do you enjoy it?

1337
01:30:01,264 --> 01:30:03,005
A lot.

1338
01:30:03,049 --> 01:30:06,139
I would say a lot.

1339
01:30:08,315 --> 01:30:10,970
This would be
a serious change for us.

1340
01:30:11,971 --> 01:30:13,973
Guess it would.

1341
01:30:14,016 --> 01:30:16,541
You guess?

1342
01:30:16,584 --> 01:30:19,282
Well, I mean, I know.

1343
01:30:19,326 --> 01:30:20,283
Oh.

1344
01:30:20,327 --> 01:30:23,852
And you know... what?

1345
01:30:23,896 --> 01:30:25,985
-Ah, for fuck's sake.
-

1346
01:30:26,028 --> 01:30:28,204
-

1347
01:30:35,342 --> 01:30:37,300
:
Do you have cash?

1348
01:30:37,344 --> 01:30:39,912
Yeah. Yeah.

1349
01:30:39,955 --> 01:30:41,566
Uh, how much is it?

1350
01:30:45,874 --> 01:30:47,963
Sixty.

1351
01:30:48,007 --> 01:30:49,965
No shit?

1352
01:31:00,019 --> 01:31:02,325
-Hey.
-: Hey.

1353
01:31:02,369 --> 01:31:03,849
This is your music.

1354
01:31:03,892 --> 01:31:05,503
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1355
01:31:05,546 --> 01:31:07,374
I-It's a bit sad, no?
Maybe I...

1356
01:31:07,417 --> 01:31:09,289
-Ah, hell no.
-Huh?

1357
01:31:09,332 --> 01:31:11,987
-No, it's beautiful.
-Yeah?

1358
01:31:12,031 --> 01:31:13,989
Yeah, you can dance to it.

1359
01:31:14,033 --> 01:31:15,513
Really?

1360
01:31:16,557 --> 01:31:18,559
No, no, no. Come here.

1361
01:31:18,603 --> 01:31:20,256
-Come here.

1362
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:21,910
I'll show you.

1363
01:31:21,954 --> 01:31:24,347
-You show me?
-Yeah, I'll show you.

1364
01:31:24,391 --> 01:31:26,959
by my side

1365
01:31:27,002 --> 01:31:28,874
This is Sammi Smith.

1366
01:31:30,658 --> 01:31:36,925
morning light

1367
01:31:43,062 --> 01:31:46,021
through the night...

1368
01:31:46,065 --> 01:31:48,067
Oh, we got eyes on us.

1369
01:31:49,111 --> 01:31:50,504
Ben...

1370
01:31:52,071 --> 01:31:53,463
Non.

1371
01:31:54,595 --> 01:31:55,683
Oui.

1372
01:31:55,727 --> 01:31:57,946
Viens.

1373
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:13,135
BILL:
Hey.

1374
01:32:13,179 --> 01:32:14,615
-Ready for it?
-Mm-hmm.

1375
01:32:20,099 --> 01:32:22,623
out of sight...

1376
01:32:24,364 --> 01:32:26,192
-Hey.
-Huh?

1377
01:32:26,235 --> 01:32:29,021
-I need to ask you something.
-What?

1378
01:32:29,064 --> 01:32:31,110
Do you really own a gun?

1379
01:32:32,633 --> 01:32:34,592
-Oh.
-

1380
01:32:34,635 --> 01:32:37,029
-Two guns.
-

1381
01:33:11,193 --> 01:33:13,239
-Hey, Maya.
-MAYA: Hmm?

1382
01:33:13,282 --> 01:33:15,328
Want to hand me my casque?

1383
01:33:16,546 --> 01:33:18,636
My casque.My helmet.
My hard hat.

1384
01:33:18,679 --> 01:33:20,550
-Oh.
-Will you get it for me?

1385
01:33:31,257 --> 01:33:33,128
Yes, ma'am.

1386
01:33:33,172 --> 01:33:35,696
Ouais!

1387
01:33:39,657 --> 01:33:41,659
-

1388
01:34:05,726 --> 01:34:06,727
BILL:
Here we go.

1389
01:34:06,771 --> 01:34:08,033
Whoa!

1390
01:34:22,612 --> 01:34:23,570
BILL:
Oh.

1391
01:34:23,613 --> 01:34:26,051
-Wow.
-

1392
01:34:50,684 --> 01:34:52,730
Damn, the place is heating up.

1393
01:34:52,773 --> 01:34:55,167
-Quoi?
-A lot of fans.

1394
01:34:55,210 --> 01:34:56,603
Going nuts.

1395
01:34:58,910 --> 01:35:00,781
Someone should tell them
they're winning.

1396
01:35:51,310 --> 01:35:53,791
-All right, let's go.

1397
01:36:25,866 --> 01:36:27,825
Pardon, pardon, pardon.

1398
01:36:53,415 --> 01:36:54,634
Bill.

1399
01:36:56,766 --> 01:36:59,247
Oh, I think I see
a friend from work.

1400
01:36:59,291 --> 01:37:00,553
Want to see if it's him.

1401
01:37:36,284 --> 01:37:37,895
Okay, let's go get the van.

1402
01:37:37,938 --> 01:37:40,462
-MAYA: Is it your friend?
-No, that wasn't him.

1403
01:37:42,943 --> 01:37:44,553
-Hey.
-VIRGINIE: Hey.

1404
01:37:44,597 --> 01:37:46,642
-How's it going?
-Uh, good. Game just ended.

1405
01:37:46,686 --> 01:37:48,253
Be home soon.

1406
01:37:48,296 --> 01:37:49,819
-Okay, take your time.
-CÇ'est maman?

1407
01:37:49,863 --> 01:37:51,734
-It's your night.
-Okay.

1408
01:37:51,778 --> 01:37:53,823
Uh, see you in a bit.

1409
01:39:07,723 --> 01:39:09,334
Wouah!

1410
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:26,829
Go back to sleep.

1411
01:39:26,873 --> 01:39:29,006
Go on.

1412
01:39:29,049 --> 01:39:30,703
We're going home.

1413
01:39:48,634 --> 01:39:49,765
CÇa va.

1414
01:39:54,118 --> 01:39:55,945
Nice to see you again.

1415
01:39:55,989 --> 01:39:57,034
You're late.

1416
01:39:57,077 --> 01:39:58,992
Oh.

1417
01:39:59,036 --> 01:40:00,385
Excusez-moi.

1418
01:40:02,909 --> 01:40:04,737
What can I do for you,
Mr. Baker?

1419
01:40:06,565 --> 01:40:08,871
That DNA test we talked about--
I want to get it done.

1420
01:40:08,915 --> 01:40:12,397
First I will need, uh,
the DNA sample.

1421
01:40:25,584 --> 01:40:27,934
Can I ask you how you got this?

1422
01:40:27,977 --> 01:40:29,936
Can you do it or not?

1423
01:40:29,979 --> 01:40:32,765
Yes, I can.

1424
01:40:34,201 --> 01:40:37,639
But I am an ex-cop,
so let me tell you,

1425
01:40:37,683 --> 01:40:39,902
it will be a serious mistake
to commit a crime

1426
01:40:39,946 --> 01:40:42,644
to prove your daughter innocent.

1427
01:40:42,688 --> 01:40:44,907
It will not get her out of jail.

1428
01:40:44,951 --> 01:40:46,518
And it will send you in.

1429
01:40:46,561 --> 01:40:48,911
-Do you understand?
-How fast can you do it?

1430
01:40:51,131 --> 01:40:52,698
It's hard to say.

1431
01:40:52,741 --> 01:40:56,136
A week at least,
but it will cost you.

1432
01:40:56,180 --> 01:40:57,920
BILL:
Here's 3,000 now.

1433
01:40:57,964 --> 01:40:59,748
I'll give you another 3,000
when you get it done,

1434
01:40:59,792 --> 01:41:01,446
but it's got to be quicker
than a week.

1435
01:41:01,489 --> 01:41:04,101
Even if it matches,
I still have to find this guy.

1436
01:41:04,144 --> 01:41:05,798
No, you don't.

1437
01:41:05,841 --> 01:41:07,582
You know where he is?

1438
01:41:11,020 --> 01:41:14,023
He could still disappear
before the results come back.

1439
01:41:14,067 --> 01:41:16,852
He won't.
Call me when you get it done.

1440
01:41:31,258 --> 01:41:32,955
Come on.

1441
01:41:33,956 --> 01:41:35,915
-

1442
01:41:37,917 --> 01:41:39,484
BILL:
Maya?

1443
01:41:42,661 --> 01:41:44,053
Maya?

1444
01:41:49,233 --> 01:41:50,625
Hey, Maya?

1445
01:41:54,194 --> 01:41:56,109
-Hey.

1446
01:41:56,153 --> 01:41:57,676
-VIRGINIE: Hey.
-

1447
01:41:57,719 --> 01:41:59,112
-This is quite a greeting.
-You seen Maya?

1448
01:41:59,156 --> 01:42:00,548
-I was in the shower.
-Yeah.

1449
01:42:00,592 --> 01:42:02,159
She's playing soccer
in the courtyard.

1450
01:42:03,203 --> 01:42:04,987
I'm sorry I'm late.

1451
01:42:05,031 --> 01:42:07,164
-Oh, that's all right.
-It...

1452
01:42:07,207 --> 01:42:09,557
Don't you want to ask me
about my first day at work?

1453
01:42:09,601 --> 01:42:11,168
Uh, yeah, yeah. How'd it go?

1454
01:42:17,043 --> 01:42:20,046
-

1455
01:42:29,273 --> 01:42:31,231
-Bill?
-Hmm?

1456
01:42:31,275 --> 01:42:33,538
Who is the man in the cave?

1457
01:42:36,671 --> 01:42:37,890
In the cave?

1458
01:42:39,152 --> 01:42:40,762
With the tools.

1459
01:42:40,806 --> 01:42:42,851
I saw him.

1460
01:42:48,727 --> 01:42:51,773
Um, I'm gonna need your help.

1461
01:42:51,817 --> 01:42:53,862
Okay?

1462
01:42:53,906 --> 01:42:56,865
'Cause it's a secret.

1463
01:42:56,909 --> 01:42:59,607
You can't tell anyone.

1464
01:42:59,651 --> 01:43:01,043
Even your mom.

1465
01:43:01,087 --> 01:43:02,654
Okay?

1466
01:43:04,308 --> 01:43:06,223
He's a bad man.

1467
01:43:06,266 --> 01:43:08,790
He'll be gone soon.

1468
01:43:09,922 --> 01:43:11,880
It's gonna be our secret.

1469
01:43:11,924 --> 01:43:13,621
Okay?

1470
01:43:17,364 --> 01:43:19,584
That's my girl.

1471
01:45:20,879 --> 01:45:22,228
:
Shit.

1472
01:45:53,390 --> 01:45:55,392
ALLISON: I learned
something new actually.

1473
01:45:56,436 --> 01:45:58,873
It's helped me a lot.

1474
01:45:58,917 --> 01:46:01,485
It's something called
the "Mektub."

1475
01:46:01,528 --> 01:46:04,531
A nurse told me about it.

1476
01:46:04,575 --> 01:46:06,054
It's about acceptance.

1477
01:46:06,098 --> 01:46:08,405
Acceptance of what?

1478
01:46:09,449 --> 01:46:11,016
Your fate.

1479
01:46:12,409 --> 01:46:15,150
It's helping me
to stop struggling so much.

1480
01:46:15,194 --> 01:46:17,457
Stop questioning everything.

1481
01:46:19,154 --> 01:46:22,419
You just embrace your fate

1482
01:46:22,462 --> 01:46:24,421
and learn to live in peace
with it.

1483
01:46:26,118 --> 01:46:28,468
It's a Muslim idea.

1484
01:46:28,512 --> 01:46:30,514
It's about...

1485
01:46:30,557 --> 01:46:33,473
letting go of all of that...

1486
01:46:35,954 --> 01:46:37,303
...shame...

1487
01:46:38,913 --> 01:46:42,264
...and guilt
that pushes you down

1488
01:46:42,308 --> 01:46:44,441
and keeps you down

1489
01:46:44,484 --> 01:46:48,227
and makes you feel
so powerless.

1490
01:46:49,184 --> 01:46:52,013
And that's how I felt
for a really long time.

1491
01:46:55,103 --> 01:46:57,149
Powerless and forgotten.

1492
01:46:59,368 --> 01:47:01,283
And...

1493
01:47:01,327 --> 01:47:04,286
that makes living really hard.

1494
01:47:05,287 --> 01:47:07,333
You know what I mean?

1495
01:47:10,554 --> 01:47:13,165
But you're innocent.

1496
01:47:14,471 --> 01:47:16,908
So we got to keep fighting.

1497
01:47:16,951 --> 01:47:19,998
It doesn't matter
that I'm innocent, Dad.

1498
01:47:21,260 --> 01:47:23,305
It's not about justice.

1499
01:47:25,656 --> 01:47:28,093
It's about finding peace.

1500
01:48:06,131 --> 01:48:07,915
I don't know
what you're saying,

1501
01:48:07,959 --> 01:48:09,961
but you're wasting your breath.

1502
01:48:10,004 --> 01:48:14,574
We're gonna wait for that DNA,
and then we'll know.

1503
01:48:14,618 --> 01:48:17,969
She ask me. She pay me.

1504
01:48:18,012 --> 01:48:19,405
You want more water?

1505
01:48:19,448 --> 01:48:22,539
Allison, she say,
"Go. You put Lina out."

1506
01:48:22,582 --> 01:48:23,540
-That's enough, now.
-"Money for you."

1507
01:48:23,583 --> 01:48:25,411
That's enough, now.

1508
01:48:25,454 --> 01:48:27,631
She tell me take it.

1509
01:48:27,674 --> 01:48:29,197
She gave me collier.

1510
01:48:29,241 --> 01:48:30,329
"You take it.

1511
01:48:30,372 --> 01:48:32,026
-Money after."
-Here.

1512
01:48:32,070 --> 01:48:33,550
Drink that.

1513
01:48:33,593 --> 01:48:34,942
Go on.

1514
01:48:36,074 --> 01:48:38,293
Un collier.
"You take it for you."

1515
01:48:38,337 --> 01:48:40,469
Collier.Gold.

1516
01:48:40,513 --> 01:48:43,255
Like this. Like this.

1517
01:48:43,298 --> 01:48:45,562
The necklace?
I-I don't want that.

1518
01:48:45,605 --> 01:48:47,520
No!

1519
01:48:47,564 --> 01:48:48,913
She gave me.

1520
01:48:48,956 --> 01:48:51,393
She say,
"Go. You put Lina out.

1521
01:48:51,437 --> 01:48:54,353
Necklace now. Money after."

1522
01:48:54,396 --> 01:48:56,050
You're not even making sense.

1523
01:48:56,094 --> 01:48:57,617
Time to shut the fuck up.

1524
01:48:57,661 --> 01:48:59,532
S-Stillwater!

1525
01:49:03,492 --> 01:49:05,016
What'd you say?

1526
01:49:05,059 --> 01:49:07,148
The collier.

1527
01:49:07,192 --> 01:49:09,063
He say "Stillwater."

1528
01:49:10,064 --> 01:49:11,936
Gold.

1529
01:49:11,979 --> 01:49:13,981
She say...

1530
01:49:14,982 --> 01:49:18,333
"Do it. Make her go.

1531
01:49:18,377 --> 01:49:20,335
Make her go out."

1532
01:49:39,659 --> 01:49:40,660
Hey.

1533
01:49:40,704 --> 01:49:42,183
-Hey.
-Where were you?

1534
01:49:42,227 --> 01:49:44,577
I walked back from
the, uh, Baumettes.

1535
01:49:44,621 --> 01:49:46,579
We have to go and see Isabelle.

1536
01:49:46,623 --> 01:49:48,059
We'll be late
if we don't leave now.

1537
01:49:48,102 --> 01:49:51,410
Do, uh... do I have to go?

1538
01:49:51,453 --> 01:49:53,107
Yes, of course.

1539
01:49:53,151 --> 01:49:54,761
I told her you were coming.

1540
01:49:54,805 --> 01:49:57,285
Hurry up, please. Maya...

1541
01:49:59,723 --> 01:50:01,681
MAYA:
Oui, maman.

1542
01:50:01,725 --> 01:50:03,770
VIRGINIE:
So, Isabelle is

1543
01:50:03,814 --> 01:50:07,034
a sort of like godmother
for us.

1544
01:50:07,078 --> 01:50:08,732
Maya really loves her.

1545
01:50:09,733 --> 01:50:11,299
Well, you'll see.

1546
01:50:11,343 --> 01:50:13,475
This is really
the other side of Marseille.

1547
01:50:18,742 --> 01:50:20,265
MAYA:
Marraine!

1548
01:50:20,308 --> 01:50:21,658
ISABELLE:
Ah.

1549
01:50:49,773 --> 01:50:51,688
: I don't
know what you're talking about.

1550
01:50:51,731 --> 01:50:54,429
BILL: The gold necklace
I gave her the day she left.

1551
01:50:54,473 --> 01:50:56,257
Said "Stillwater" on it.

1552
01:50:56,301 --> 01:50:58,172
Yeah, I remember it.
What about it?

1553
01:50:58,216 --> 01:51:00,348
D-Do you remember, was
she wearing it at the trial?

1554
01:51:00,392 --> 01:51:02,394
Did she still have it on?

1555
01:51:02,437 --> 01:51:04,178
What are you getting into,
Bill?

1556
01:51:04,222 --> 01:51:07,225
Wh-When we went to get
her stuff, did you see it?

1557
01:51:07,268 --> 01:51:08,487
Oh, I don't know.

1558
01:51:08,530 --> 01:51:10,402
I don't remember. Why?

1559
01:51:10,445 --> 01:51:12,360
I'll talk to you later, Sharon.
Bye.

1560
01:51:14,449 --> 01:51:16,364
VIRGINIE:
CÇa va?

1561
01:51:16,408 --> 01:51:18,323
Yeah. Yeah, ça va.

1562
01:51:19,367 --> 01:51:20,717
Uh, talking to Sharon.

1563
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:23,371
-Is she okay?
-Yeah, yeah, she's fine.

1564
01:51:23,415 --> 01:51:24,546
Are you?

1565
01:51:24,590 --> 01:51:26,548
What do you mean?

1566
01:51:26,592 --> 01:51:29,334
You just seem distrait.

1567
01:51:30,335 --> 01:51:32,598
I am. Sorry.

1568
01:51:34,165 --> 01:51:35,557
I'm happy you're here.

1569
01:51:36,733 --> 01:51:38,386
Me, too.

1570
01:51:38,430 --> 01:51:40,693
You, too?

1571
01:51:40,737 --> 01:51:42,695
Y-You're-you're happy
you're here?

1572
01:51:42,739 --> 01:51:44,741
-I am.

1573
01:51:45,785 --> 01:51:47,265
Really.

1574
01:51:48,788 --> 01:51:50,355
Me, too.

1575
01:51:51,835 --> 01:51:53,793
I like you, Bill Baker.

1576
01:52:03,237 --> 01:52:04,456
Okay, come.

1577
01:52:15,859 --> 01:52:17,599
-BILL: Mr. Dirosa,

1578
01:52:17,643 --> 01:52:18,905
it's Bill Baker.

1579
01:52:18,949 --> 01:52:21,386
Uh, really need that result.

1580
01:52:21,429 --> 01:52:23,867
Uh, it's kind of urgent.

1581
01:53:03,297 --> 01:53:05,169
DIROSA:
Bonjour, madame.

1582
01:53:05,212 --> 01:53:06,344
Bonjour.

1583
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:51,215
Bonne journée.

1584
01:53:51,258 --> 01:53:52,651
Au revoir.

1585
01:54:15,630 --> 01:54:17,589
You know, I used to fight
a lot at school

1586
01:54:17,632 --> 01:54:19,852
when I was a kid, too.

1587
01:54:19,896 --> 01:54:22,899
But that's not good. Fight? No.

1588
01:54:26,424 --> 01:54:28,469
You sure you don't want this?

1589
01:54:29,949 --> 01:54:33,257
The man in the cave,
you will kill?

1590
01:54:33,300 --> 01:54:35,259
What? No.

1591
01:54:35,302 --> 01:54:36,869
Of course not.

1592
01:54:42,875 --> 01:54:45,922
I would never, ever do anything
to hurt you or your mother.

1593
01:54:45,965 --> 01:54:46,923
Never.

1594
01:54:50,448 --> 01:54:52,319
Because I love both of you.

1595
01:54:52,363 --> 01:54:53,930
So much.

1596
01:54:54,974 --> 01:54:56,541
I do.

1597
01:54:59,587 --> 01:55:01,720
You just have to trust me.

1598
01:55:01,763 --> 01:55:02,939
Okay?

1599
01:55:05,463 --> 01:55:07,291
Okay.

1600
01:55:29,922 --> 01:55:32,577
Mr. Baker, a word please.

1601
01:55:32,620 --> 01:55:34,361
Police.

1602
01:55:34,405 --> 01:55:37,321
Can I see your I.D. please?

1603
01:55:37,364 --> 01:55:39,410
Your I.D., Mr. Baker.

1604
01:55:44,632 --> 01:55:46,025
Thank you.

1605
01:55:46,069 --> 01:55:47,984
Take off your cap.

1606
01:55:52,379 --> 01:55:54,599
Okay. Thank you.

1607
01:55:56,122 --> 01:55:57,819
So, Mr. Baker, my colleagues

1608
01:55:57,863 --> 01:55:59,647
are gonna take
the little girl inside.

1609
01:55:59,691 --> 01:56:01,345
Okay?

1610
01:56:01,388 --> 01:56:02,824
-No, Bill. -Okay, all right,
all right, all right.

1611
01:56:02,868 --> 01:56:04,565
It's okay. It's all right.

1612
01:56:04,609 --> 01:56:05,784
-You go with her.
-No.

1613
01:56:05,827 --> 01:56:07,481
Tout va bien. Tout va bien.

1614
01:56:07,525 --> 01:56:08,569
It's all right.

1615
01:56:11,703 --> 01:56:12,834
You're all right.

1616
01:56:12,878 --> 01:56:14,880
CAPTAIN:
So, Mr. Baker, look at me.

1617
01:56:16,534 --> 01:56:18,884
Do you have a basement here?

1618
01:56:20,886 --> 01:56:22,453
Yes or no?

1619
01:56:23,932 --> 01:56:25,064
Yes, sir.

1620
01:56:25,108 --> 01:56:27,675
Okay. Give me the keys please.

1621
01:56:50,002 --> 01:56:51,047
CAPTAIN:
Please.

1622
01:57:06,584 --> 01:57:08,455
Stop.

1623
01:57:27,648 --> 01:57:29,128
Stop.

1624
01:57:45,710 --> 01:57:46,972
Do you have the key?

1625
01:57:47,973 --> 01:57:50,106
Mr. Baker.

1626
01:57:50,149 --> 01:57:51,803
He's got it.

1627
01:58:16,088 --> 01:58:18,786
CAPTAIN:
Let's go upstairs.

1628
01:58:24,792 --> 01:58:26,577
DETECTIVE:
Sit.

1629
01:58:58,957 --> 01:59:00,132
Viens.

1630
01:59:03,570 --> 01:59:04,876
:
Vas-y, chérie.

1631
01:59:19,891 --> 01:59:20,892
Oui.

1632
01:59:24,330 --> 01:59:26,027
-Oui.
-Ah.

1633
01:59:35,211 --> 01:59:36,560
Oui.

1634
01:59:45,090 --> 01:59:46,265
Ah.

1635
02:00:16,904 --> 02:00:18,079
-Non?
-Non.

1636
02:00:19,690 --> 02:00:21,257
-Oui.
-Mm.

1637
02:01:12,743 --> 02:01:13,961
Okay.

1638
02:01:40,379 --> 02:01:41,728
Virginie, I didn't mean to...

1639
02:01:41,772 --> 02:01:43,426
How did you find him?

1640
02:01:45,297 --> 02:01:47,212
Pure chance.

1641
02:01:47,255 --> 02:01:48,909
The soccer game.

1642
02:01:50,433 --> 02:01:52,043
With Maya?

1643
02:01:59,442 --> 02:02:01,357
Did you ask her to lie?

1644
02:02:03,010 --> 02:02:04,708
Did you?

1645
02:02:05,839 --> 02:02:08,364
I never meant
to involve you or Maya.

1646
02:02:12,368 --> 02:02:14,065
-I know...
-You...

1647
02:02:16,067 --> 02:02:17,764
You have to leave now.

1648
02:02:21,289 --> 02:02:24,467
Okay. You pack your things,
you leave.

1649
02:02:37,523 --> 02:02:39,395
May I come in?

1650
02:02:45,270 --> 02:02:46,837
Maya?

1651
02:02:52,277 --> 02:02:54,279
You don't want to talk to me?

1652
02:02:55,585 --> 02:02:57,369
All right.

1653
02:03:00,111 --> 02:03:01,808
I'm sorry.

1654
02:03:05,943 --> 02:03:07,988
I'm so sorry.

1655
02:03:14,299 --> 02:03:15,474
I love you.

1656
02:03:48,202 --> 02:03:49,552
VIRGINIE:
Bill.

1657
02:03:50,553 --> 02:03:51,815
MAYA:
Non.

1658
02:04:45,521 --> 02:04:47,000
Mr. Baker,

1659
02:04:47,044 --> 02:04:50,003
I've come with some
extraordinary news.

1660
02:04:50,047 --> 02:04:52,397
The judge in your daughter's
case called me this morning.

1661
02:04:52,440 --> 02:04:54,138
New evidence has surfaced.

1662
02:04:54,181 --> 02:04:56,140
Apparently, a retired cop

1663
02:04:56,183 --> 02:04:59,360
came up with a DNA match
on the unknown sample.

1664
02:04:59,404 --> 02:05:02,363
It also matched
a sample the police collected

1665
02:05:02,407 --> 02:05:04,235
on a burglary case
four years ago,

1666
02:05:04,278 --> 02:05:06,237
after the trial.

1667
02:05:06,280 --> 02:05:07,586
Did they catch him?

1668
02:05:07,630 --> 02:05:10,067
No, not yet.

1669
02:05:10,110 --> 02:05:13,505
But all we need to prove
is sufficient doubt.

1670
02:05:13,549 --> 02:05:16,203
So even if they can't
find the suspect,

1671
02:05:16,247 --> 02:05:18,379
there's a real chance
they will release Allison.

1672
02:05:19,380 --> 02:05:21,600
In fact, the judge
has already agreed

1673
02:05:21,644 --> 02:05:26,257
to reopen the investigation,
which is almost unheard of.

1674
02:05:27,301 --> 02:05:29,608
I think this could only happen
in Marseille.

1675
02:05:36,746 --> 02:05:39,270
Thank you for coming
to tell me, ma'am.

1676
02:05:39,313 --> 02:05:43,056
Mr. Baker, this is
the best possible outcome

1677
02:05:43,100 --> 02:05:44,580
for your family.

1678
02:05:44,623 --> 02:05:46,103
Do you understand?

1679
02:05:46,146 --> 02:05:48,061
I do.

1680
02:05:49,106 --> 02:05:50,586
Thank you, ma'am.

1681
02:06:16,133 --> 02:06:17,656
-MAN: Go, Pokes!

1682
02:06:22,661 --> 02:06:24,750
I told you we were gonna
bring our girl home,

1683
02:06:24,794 --> 02:06:27,231
and that's exactly what we did.

1684
02:06:31,627 --> 02:06:33,498
Welcome home, Allison.

1685
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:36,414
Welcome back to Oklahoma.

1686
02:06:37,763 --> 02:06:39,460
Welcome back to America!

1687
02:07:07,750 --> 02:07:09,447
-

1688
02:07:29,467 --> 02:07:31,208
You're being antisocial?

1689
02:07:36,648 --> 02:07:38,258
You all right?

1690
02:07:44,787 --> 02:07:48,529
The day you left for Marseille,

1691
02:07:48,573 --> 02:07:51,532
Sharon and I drove you
to the airport, and...

1692
02:07:51,576 --> 02:07:54,361
when we got there,

1693
02:07:54,405 --> 02:07:57,669
I was embarrassed I didn't have
a present or nothing,

1694
02:07:57,713 --> 02:08:00,672
so I went to the gift shop.

1695
02:08:01,673 --> 02:08:05,329
I thought I'd get you a book
or a key chain or something.

1696
02:08:06,417 --> 02:08:08,462
Then I saw this necklace.

1697
02:08:10,377 --> 02:08:14,251
I thought it'd be like a little
piece of home to take with you.

1698
02:08:15,643 --> 02:08:17,689
It was gold.

1699
02:08:17,733 --> 02:08:19,604
Said "Stillwater" on it.

1700
02:08:33,705 --> 02:08:36,621
:
I didn't want it to happen.

1701
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:42,583
He told me that
he would just help me

1702
02:08:42,627 --> 02:08:44,803
get her out of the apartment,
that's all.

1703
02:08:46,631 --> 02:08:49,199
I didn't want her to die.

1704
02:08:50,809 --> 02:08:52,768
I loved her.

1705
02:08:54,291 --> 02:08:56,423
I know you did.

1706
02:08:58,295 --> 02:09:00,297
You think I'm a monster?

1707
02:09:01,689 --> 02:09:02,821
You're my daughter.

1708
02:09:02,865 --> 02:09:05,824
I... I could never think that.

1709
02:09:08,740 --> 02:09:11,221
Dad, what is wrong with us?

1710
02:09:14,485 --> 02:09:17,183
I don't know, baby girl.

1711
02:09:17,227 --> 02:09:19,185
I don't know.

1712
02:09:19,229 --> 02:09:21,535
:
I'm sorry.

1713
02:09:21,579 --> 02:09:23,146
I'm so sorry.

1714
02:09:24,582 --> 02:09:27,193
I'm sorry.

1715
02:09:31,371 --> 02:09:32,895
Me, too.

1716
02:10:17,940 --> 02:10:21,247
from my hair

1717
02:10:23,815 --> 02:10:28,385
and let it fall

1718
02:10:30,387 --> 02:10:33,912
against your skin

1719
02:10:36,523 --> 02:10:39,918
on the wall...

1720
02:10:46,969 --> 02:10:48,796
Morning.

1721
02:10:48,840 --> 02:10:50,407
Hey.

1722
02:10:53,062 --> 02:10:55,629
Couldn't sleep.

1723
02:10:56,804 --> 02:10:59,459
Went for a walk, and...

1724
02:10:59,503 --> 02:11:01,635
ended up here.

1725
02:11:04,334 --> 02:11:05,901
I'm glad you did.

1726
02:11:11,645 --> 02:11:13,386
You miss them?

1727
02:11:17,477 --> 02:11:19,001
I do.

1728
02:11:20,611 --> 02:11:21,960
Can you go back?

1729
02:11:24,006 --> 02:11:25,790
No, I can't.

1730
02:11:28,619 --> 02:11:30,534
But it was good.

1731
02:11:30,577 --> 02:11:32,449
That don't change.

1732
02:11:37,367 --> 02:11:38,934
:
I'm sorry.

1733
02:11:41,893 --> 02:11:43,808
Life is brutal.

1734
02:12:00,956 --> 02:12:03,480
Everything looks the same here.

1735
02:12:05,830 --> 02:12:07,701
Nothing's changed.

1736
02:12:09,790 --> 02:12:11,357
Don't you think?

1737
02:12:15,361 --> 02:12:17,407
No, Ally, I don't.

1738
02:12:19,713 --> 02:12:21,933
It all looks different to me.

1739
02:12:23,848 --> 02:12:26,372
I don't hardly
recognize it anymore.
