1
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,022
0-12!

2
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,025
0-12!

3
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,654
This is 0-12.

4
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,573
0-12, why didn't you answer?

5
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,535
My engine is on fire.

6
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:20,622
Request for permission to activate
the fire extinguishing system.

7
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,248
Negative!

8
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,501
It will turn the engine off immediately!

9
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:25,960
Roger that.

10
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,257
Drift down to 1000 feet,
aim the plane to the field...

11
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,384
and activate the ejection seat. Copy?

12
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,803
Roger that. I'm drifting down.

13
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,658
Markelov, is the ejector prepared?
Markelov, are you deaf or what?

14
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,618
Did you remove the pin from the ejector?

15
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,415
0-12, Leonov? Why are you doing nothing?

16
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,880
Reply! I order you to...

17
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,806
Damn it!
He has shut off the engine.

18
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,537
What the hell...

19
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,622
Drive straight to the runway.
- Yes, sir.

20
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:56,176
The commission is here.
- Which commission?
- General Kamanin.

21
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:03,558
He's trying to extinguish the fire.

22
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:08,438
Come on, my little bird! Come on!

23
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,485
There we go!

24
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,577
Hold on!

25
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,796
Lyosha!

26
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,150
Markelov...

27
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,321
rascal.

28
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:12,543
Comrade General, as commander of the
294th Air Reconnaissance Division...
- At ease!

29
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,963
What kind of theater was that?

30
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:19,259
It even had smoke effects.

31
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,135
Lyosha, are you OK?

32
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,266
Why didn't you jump?
We were worried at the end!

33
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,561
Here! Hide it.

34
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,693
And what should we tell them, Lyosha?

35
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,861
Well, uh, uh...

36
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,990
We'll say we were saving
expensive Soviet equipment.
Come on!

37
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,285
What was going on?
- Luckily you survived...

38
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,246
The equipment is old.
The engine failed.

39
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,665
We will investigate
and find who is responsible.

40
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,125
Who is the pilot?

41
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:56,170
Lieutenant Leonov.
We'll have a talk with him.

42
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,673
The man is a madman.

43
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,885
I've never seen anything like that!
Madness! You're a hero.

44
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,263
He should come to me.

45
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,224
We are in need of such crazy people.

46
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:17,650
SPACEWALKER

47
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:38,583
1963: INSTITUTE FOR EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH NO. 1

48
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,197
1965!

49
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,629
1965.

50
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,300
They can all go.

51
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,846
I said you can go.

52
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,606
Why in 1965?

53
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,068
Why?

54
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,488
It is supposed to be in 1967.

55
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,992
By that year Voskhod 2
could be prepared 100%.

56
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,871
Why 1965? Because the Americans
have moved their flight.

57
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:03,417
They want to be first in space before us.

58
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,503
It's unacceptable.

59
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,589
But to allow an unprepared
product into space...

60
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:13,177
with USSR printed on its broadside...
is acceptable?

61
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,513
To fall flat on our face in front
of the whole world... is acceptable?

62
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,890
And to get two heroic corpses,

63
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:22,144
instead of two living astronauts
welcomed on their return?

64
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:25,898
We'll make sure that the space capsule
is reliable. But time is short.

65
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,234
Two space capsules.

66
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,653
The first serves as a test.

67
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,324
We have to deal with all eventualities
to be prepared.

68
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,786
The rest depends on the pilots,
and luckily...

69
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,538
we have two of the best.

70
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,612
How many combat missions
did you have in the war?

71
00:10:14,955 --> 00:10:16,324
Stop bugging me, Lyosh.

72
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,869
We're approaching the takeoff point.

73
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,458
The cloud cover is very low.
And the wind is increasing.

74
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:30,046
- How low?
- Ceiling is 1300 feet, without light gaps.
The wind is 12 points, gusty.

75
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,714
Should we go back?

76
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,133
Yes, turn back.

77
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,886
Let's jump. It's just wind.

78
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,471
With just a little wind...

79
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,682
chances are 1 in 10,
that we come down safe. Here!

80
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,980
You can't turn back in space.

81
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,859
There will be different
instructions in space, Lyosh.

82
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,695
What did they choose us for?

83
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,822
Why us, why not someone else?

84
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,409
I haven't thought about that yet.

85
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:04,038
To handle impossible tasks.

86
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,625
Eat your apple. It tastes good.

87
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,467
I'll eat it at home.

88
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,222
Lyosh, you didn't get it?
We aren't jumping now.

89
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,224
Who says so?
- Instructions.

90
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,729
Don't get bored!

91
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,442
Vlad, shut the door behind me!

92
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,655
Stay calm, Pasha! Pull out!

93
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:20,740
Pull out!

94
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,165
Unwind!

95
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,208
Unwind!

96
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,336
Feet together!

97
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,841
What?
- Feet together!

98
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:03,282
Come along.

99
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,583
Keep walking! Lyosha!

100
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:23,636
Don't touch it!

101
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:27,139
If the bird scents you,
he will not come back.

102
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,225
Is that his home?
-Yes.

103
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,977
And does he sleep here, too?
- Why should I know that?

104
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:35,564
But I want to know
where the bird sleeps, dad.

105
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:39,151
If you really want to know, you'll find out.
Come on, let's move on.

106
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,073
Come on, Loyosha! Hurry up!

107
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:59,338
The content is correct, only the form is not.
- Attention!

108
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,465
It is not official enough.

109
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,259
Comrade General, permission to speak?
-No.

110
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,927
I'm sorry, may I ask...

111
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,055
I would like to visit Lieutenant Colonel Belyaev.

112
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,392
That's what the doctors should decide.
- They have but he does not want to see anyone.

113
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,144
He is depressed.
I want to awaken his fighting spirit.

114
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,188
What's with your leg?

115
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,816
Oh nothing.
Just fell asleep while waiting.

116
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,651
Leonov...

117
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,571
Do you know why I didn't give you
a kick in the pants yet?

118
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,239
No.

119
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,409
Neither do I.
Continue with your training.

120
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,161
Thank you, Comrade General.
We'll do our best.

121
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:35,332
Once Pavel is released ...
- Your new partner is Major Khrunov.

122
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,501
And what about Pavel?

123
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,838
He could not help it. He did not want to jump.
I provoked him.

124
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:44,174
I know. I have read your report.

125
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:50,014
Do not get upset.
Belyaev should first get back on his feet.

126
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,976
He is no longer so young.
He will soon be 40. Let him regain his health.

127
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,354
We have to keep the schedule.

128
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,482
You are training with Khrunov for now.

129
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,234
Yes, sir.

130
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,422
The food is getting cold.

131
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,551
Not bad.

132
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:31,931
Sveta, I've already told you, that is
the worst compliment for an artist.

133
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,643
It's not a compliment for an artist,
but it is for a cosmonaut with a paintbrush.

134
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,146
Who, by the way, could have become
a very good artist.

135
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,149
Please, you're blocking my light...
But what about space?

136
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,695
A good painter does not need a rocket,

137
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,281
to travel to the stars.

138
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,785
But I see the stars
through the ceiling.

139
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,954
No, it's rather...

140
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,914
I do not see the ceiling at all,

141
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,875
only the sky.

142
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,420
I would if I could
go by bike to the moon.

143
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,216
But such bicycles do not exist.
- Let's eat.

144
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,469
May I eat the apple?
- After dinner.

145
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,973
So let's go have dinner now.
-I beg your pardon?

146
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:44,795
Hello!

147
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,260
Alright.

148
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,346
Right, keep silent.

149
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,307
Then I will talk.

150
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,143
So...

151
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,062
Let's start with the program...

152
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,148
for physical exercise.

153
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,608
I only have one life.

154
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:12,531
And I only have one partner.
I do not fly with anyone else.

155
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:17,536
I am training with Khrunov, but only
so as not to get out of practice.

156
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,998
And once you're in shape,
we'll go to our supervisor...

157
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:24,835
and request a medical examination.
It will be allright.

158
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,714
The most important thing is, that
it's not broken. Right? That's good.

159
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,050
Your old injury has returned.

160
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,094
But that's not bad. It'll heal up.

161
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,097
Some people get their head split open.
But that's just the leg.
- Alexey.

162
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,515
Look at me.

163
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,018
And listen to me.

164
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,938
I will not go anywhere with you.
- You do not like me anymore?

165
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,233
That's not it.

166
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,986
But you know no fear.
And that is not good.

167
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,952
I'll tell you something from my childhood.

168
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,289
Go away.
- Then you will understand immediately.

169
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,917
Did not you hear?
- Leonov doesn't leave just like that.

170
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,878
I'll finish this and then I'll go.

171
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,179
Very carefully... ok move now.

172
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,892
One...

173
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,811
two.

174
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,687
One...

175
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,024
It works...

176
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,112
Wait, I'll help you! Does it hurt a lot?

177
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,988
Get out! Go to hell!

178
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,824
What's happened?

179
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,742
Get out!

180
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,871
It's all right. Nothing happened.

181
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,666
Get lost!

182
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,459
All right.

183
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,635
Good day!

184
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,303
Should I scratch for you?

185
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,807
Scratch yourself.

186
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,767
In an hour.

187
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,358
During the exercises
in weightlessness...

188
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:57,554
you never made any successful attempts
of entry into the airlock?

189
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,781
Why not, Comrade Major?

190
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:03,785
There are several reasons.
One is the space suit.

191
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:10,042
It is called the "Golden Eagle",
but it is a coffin of asbestos.

192
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,920
I have a few suggestions. May I?

193
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,297
Boris Victorovich!

194
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,842
To pull the tether,

195
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,844
you need better control
over the body,

196
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,181
which would require more agility.

197
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,309
You would need hinges on the shoulder,

198
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,646
elbows, knees and wrists for
greater freedom of movement.

199
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,606
Did you draw that yourself?
- Yes, sir.

200
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,525
This takes into account
the pressure in the spacesuit.

201
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,194
Listen...

202
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:41,406
To build such a spacesuit,
takes at least two years.

203
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:45,410
If not 2.5.
- And we do not have time, Comrade Leonov.
- I see.

204
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,205
But what if we shift the tether
attachment points for the supply line...

205
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,707
to the helmet?

206
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,752
What do you mean?
What is that supposed to help?

207
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:59,007
Our cosmonaut enters with his feet
first in the lock, right? Right.

208
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,843
I feel, it would be better, if the
cosmonaut could see where he is going...

209
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,637
and go in with his head first.

210
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,354
Comrades, please leave us alone for a moment.

211
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,984
Go ahead.
- Me?
- Yes.

212
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,736
How exactly do you want me to do this?

213
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,447
Head first. Show it to me.

214
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,410
Go ahead.

215
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:34,710
And now turn back to face the hatch.

216
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:39,589
Why?
- To close the outer hatch. Manually.

217
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:44,011
But it closes automatically.
- In nine out of ten cases.

218
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,263
What if you are unlucky this time?

219
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:53,645
What if your spacesuit gets stiff...

220
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,398
and the oxygen is running out?

221
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:01,069
Can you imagine it?
- Yes.
- Then you are dead.

222
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,780
And your partner too.

223
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:08,785
Now we know, Sergey Pavlovich.
We'll try to deal with what we have.
Sorry for bothering you.

224
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,871
Sergey Pavlovich,

225
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,999
we are ready to fly even in shackles,

226
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:18,170
or in a knight's armor.
- Our people have always been in shackles.

227
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,591
But imagine, if they were removed.

228
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:23,842
What would happen then?

229
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,389
We'd lose balance and crash

230
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,309
and everything would go to hell.

231
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,729
That's how it is with us.

232
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:40,275
You can go.
-Yes, sir.

233
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,235
The drawing...

234
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,029
Leave her here.

235
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:08,095
Yevgeny Anatolyevich,
Belyaev is not feeling well!

236
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,846
What do you mean?

237
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,264
Damn it!

238
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,988
Comrade Belyaev, what are you doing there?

239
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,787
You said I should start
to excercise my leg.

240
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,540
Yes, but not like that.

241
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,959
I meant, slowly. This will need time.

242
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,674
But I have no time Yevgeny Anatolyevich.

243
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,893
That old pilot amazes me!

244
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:00,981
Do you know what I like most about you?
- What?

245
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:04,192
Your smile. Smile again.

246
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,903
Gagarin in person.

247
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,168
Pasha!

248
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,883
Nice that you're back.

249
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,271
Squad, line up!

250
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,356
On the ground!

251
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:44,858
Excuse me.

252
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,402
Comrade Belyaev, line up!
- Yes, sir.

253
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,613
Welcome back!
- Thank you.

254
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,865
One, two...

255
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,100
INSTITUTE FOR EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH, NO. 1

256
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,685
120 DAYS TO LAUNCH

257
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:21,853
Nikishin!

258
00:25:23,146 --> 00:25:24,397
Nikishin!

259
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,567
Go home and get some sleep.

260
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:30,487
Finish tomorrow.
Sergei Pavlovich,

261
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:34,783
people need rest. For three weeks now...

262
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,328
they've been working in three shifts.
- Soon.

263
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,081
After the examination board
everyone will get a day off.

264
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:45,752
One day.
- Let's put the head of the
commission into the spaceship.

265
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,297
He'll feel like Gagarin, and be content.

266
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:52,592
Then we'll go to the celebration dinner
and after throw them all out again.

267
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,220
Throwing them out is ok.

268
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,597
But no outsiders in the spaceship,

269
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,891
not even Brezhnev himself.

270
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,568
What happened?

271
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,152
Nikishin?
- Step aside.

272
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,905
Shine it on the chest and head area.

273
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,158
Well?

274
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,663
He's dead.

275
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,206
Oh God!

276
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:27,168
I want to know exactly what happened.

277
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:30,297
Exactly. Boris Evseevich,

278
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:33,967
report back to me in half an hour
what went wrong...

279
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,845
with the electronics.
- Yes.

280
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:42,309
I take it that the visitation is cancelled?
- No way! I want them to see all of this.

281
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:45,020
It is important that they see it for themselves...

282
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,772
and report it to whom they should.

283
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,867
You could have done better,
Comrade Lieutenant Colonel.

284
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:04,122
One second. Would you please
give this to Svetlana Egorovna?

285
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,791
With pleasure.
- Because today is such a beautiful day.

286
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,918
Good.
- And for her wise decision making.

287
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,425
What's this?
- Someone asked me to give it to you.

288
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,430
Put it here.

289
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:28,271
Comrade Lieutenant Colonel,
I have no objections for now.

290
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:32,651
Let's change the workload, and
then we'll check the blood pressure.

291
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,779
Here's for our ladies!

292
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,947
Hooray!

293
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,825
Say...

294
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:44,871
By the way, what do I call a lady
who is a cosmonaut?

295
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,415
Female cosmonaut or lady cosmonaut?

296
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,879
You've said already, "for our ladies."

297
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,090
How did it go with the medical commission?

298
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,184
What did they say?

299
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,229
Not suitable.
That's the decision.

300
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,606
Stop, wait a second...

301
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,109
That was the decision?

302
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,319
And how did they justify it?

303
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:20,490
Anything specific?
- "Not suitable. Too old and injured," they said.

304
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:24,119
"You can not run well with such a leg."

305
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,162
I see.

306
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:27,622
And you just accepted that?

307
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,542
So who am I going to fly with now?

308
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,002
You are my partner.
Why are you deserting me?

309
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:36,965
Lyosh, what are you doing?
Am I your partner?

310
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,968
There is your partner.

311
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,357
We don't serve our own whims,
but the common goal.

312
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,902
The doctors are right,
I'm ill-suited for the task.
- I do not care about the doctors.

313
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,821
If I fly, it's only with you.

314
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:03,032
Are you really going to run in space?
- The general is leaving! Fall in!

315
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,454
Attention!

316
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:11,666
Run or not. You can't outrun fate.

317
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,169
Things didn't work out for me.

318
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,422
One can't outrun fate?

319
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,508
Lyosha!

320
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,056
Lyosha!

321
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,184
It seems we must conquer
space without them now.

322
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:34,355
Are you out of your mind, Comrade Major?
Do you want to be thrown out of the squad?

323
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:35,774
Comrade General!

324
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,984
May I speak briefly sir?

325
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:43,448
What did you want, Comrade Leonov?
- Did you see him running? Did you?

326
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,158
So he's able. Not half able.

327
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,410
That's all?
- Yes... I mean, yes, sir!

328
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,538
You can go.
- Yes, sir.

329
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,919
You can go!

330
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:05,053
I'd like to see the results
of the medical commission.

331
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:15,647
0 GRAVITY

332
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,392
Almaz-2 in the airlock!

333
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,855
Well done, Almaz-2!

334
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,654
START OF THE UNMANNED TEST MODULE

335
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,032
So, comrades cosmonauts...

336
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,368
during the tests we'll make a film...

337
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,412
about the everyday life of our Soviet heroes.

338
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,790
I feel like a pop singer.
- Better than a singer.

339
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,208
Scene 1, Take 3.

340
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:22,463
Today we are gathered here
not to celebrate victory,

341
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,090
but to make sure...

342
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:27,969
that this victory is possible.

343
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:31,681
Attention, get ready and... action!
- Go to papa.
- Papa!

344
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,893
Papa! Ouch!
- Easy. Easy.
- Stop.

345
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,604
Let's go again.

346
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:40,899
Key to ignition.

347
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,402
I had a bad dream.

348
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:45,862
That does not mean anything.
- Stop.

349
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,697
The launch of the unmanned module...

350
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:53,369
will be performed at 10:30 today Moscow time.

351
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:58,917
In this attempt,  the ship will reach
orbit for testing purposes.

352
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,337
Come on, Svet.
- All right.
- There are people here...

353
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:06,007
Do not worry.
- "Farewell to the Cosmonauts",
Part 2, Scene 3, 1st Take.

354
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:09,969
Our task is to run a full test of the equipment.

355
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:10,887
Ignition.

356
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,555
All systems from Voskhod 2...

357
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,016
and the inflatable airlock...

358
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:18,102
will be considered successfully tested,

359
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,564
once the unmanned module...

360
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,776
has returned to earth undamaged.
- Launch.

361
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,195
Papa!

362
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,575
We must be sure about the accuracy...

363
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,036
of our calculations...

364
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,871
before cosmonauts Pavel Belyaev...

365
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,457
and Alexey Leonov fly into space.

366
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,209
"The spacecraft has reached orbit"

367
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:45,254
Our heroes have a very special mission.

368
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:46,464
"The airlock is open"

369
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,343
They will go outside the capsule for
the first time ever...

370
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,222
and have a spacewalk in outer space.

371
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,015
"Simulated spacewalk has been implemented"

372
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,893
If this mission succeeds,

373
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,728
we will be ready soon for...

374
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:04,691
when we can be with space as equals,

375
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:07,402
as friends.

376
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:08,820
Take cover!

377
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:15,702
"Attention! The connection with
the test module has been lost"

378
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:19,998
"Repeat, the connection with the test
module has been lost"

379
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,417
"Confirm, observing the cloud of wreckage"

380
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,855
Good to see you, Sergey Pavlovich.
- Good to see you.

381
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,481
You are kindly requested.

382
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:55,950
Good to see you, Leonid Ilyich.

383
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,244
Wait a moment, Sergey Pavlovich.

384
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,496
Let's finish the movie and then talk.

385
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,584
I do not have time to watch movies.

386
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,045
We are in a race against time.

387
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,672
We are getting the floor
pulled from under our feet.

388
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:14,052
That does not happen to
those who keep step...

389
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:18,097
and you're Sergey Pavlovich,
an engine for progress.

390
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:26,064
I have a comprehensive report here
with all the technical details.

391
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,483
I'll summarize it briefly.

392
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:33,029
If something is unclear, please ask.
- I already know.

393
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,239
The spacecraft reached orbit.

394
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:39,994
The spacewalk was simulated.

395
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,831
And now do the same thing again,

396
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:48,544
but this time with two cosmonauts,
and collect a Gold Star.

397
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:51,714
But the ship fell apart,
and we do not know why.

398
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,217
We are still searching for the cause.
- Was there a spacewalk?

399
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:59,430
Conditionally, yes.
- Now do it unconditionally.

400
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:04,310
The United States wants to launch
their spacecraft in May.

401
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,938
That's why Voskhod has to fly earlier.

402
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,733
So that the whole world knows
that we are the first.

403
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:15,655
Our time in space is happening now.

404
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:19,325
It is the time of pioneers!
- I do not care about the Americans.

405
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,703
I understand that the main thing for us,
for our country...

406
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,540
is not to fall flat on our face.

407
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:28,793
But as long as I carry the responsibility,

408
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:33,047
an unprepared spacecraft won't go to space.

409
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,508
All the more, if my people are inside.

410
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,052
Only over my dead body!
- Is that a fact?

411
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,804
I'm serious.

412
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,765
You know what?

413
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,226
Sleep on it first.

414
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,771
And tomorrow get back to work.

415
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,190
We do not have anyone else but you.

416
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,068
You are irreplaceable for us.

417
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,262
COSMONAUT QUARTERS BAIKONUR

418
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,347
ONE DAY TO LAUNCH

419
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:37,403
I wonder if it's snowing in Moscow too.
If so, I can go ski with the girls.

420
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:43,326
Yeah, right... build a snowman, eat pierogies.

421
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,036
Was everything in vain?

422
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:48,456
Don't drink and start rambling.

423
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,043
So we don't fly?

424
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:56,255
I don't think about it.
There are rules.

425
00:36:56,422 --> 00:37:00,426
We've spent so much time and effort.
All sizzle, no steak.
What are they thinking?

426
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,345
What do you want to do?

427
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:05,306
You want Korolyov to trust luck
and appoint the launch?

428
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:10,394
Not luck, Pasha, we took apart that ship
cog by cog, and put it back together.

429
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,605
I have confidence in it like in my own mother.

430
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,524
But you're just standing around and packing!

431
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,195
Do you think you're the only one
who wants to fly to space?

432
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,704
OK, well...
we have to obey the orders.

433
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,499
I don't care about the orders.

434
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,253
I won't back down.

435
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,590
Yes?

436
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:43,302
Good morning, Sergey Pavlovich.
- Good morning, Comrade Chief Designer.

437
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,054
Good Morning.

438
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,811
You've been up for a while?
- No. Just got up. Drinking tea.

439
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:58,359
As you know, the test flight failed.

440
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:04,282
Launching Voskhod 2 with
people is too risky.

441
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,034
We'll repeatedly launch an empty module...

442
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,662
on the rocket until it's perfected.

443
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:13,207
We'll build a new one in a year,
and then you'll fly.

444
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,294
Alright.
- What is your problem?

445
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,713
That the Americans will be the first?

446
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,549
Sergey Pavlovich, we are in
peak physical condition.

447
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:23,884
We worked over 3000 emergency situations.

448
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:27,513
There will be a 3001st, 3002nd,
and 3003rd in space.

449
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:32,226
Sending you up now,
would mean your certain death.

450
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,688
And the country would cry for only a moment.
- Why are you here then?

451
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,483
You are a farmer.

452
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,652
From the village Listvyanka.

453
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:44,071
In the district Kemerovo.

454
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,748
When I was three, my father became
condemned as an enemy of the people.

455
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:57,376
And we were marked as a family of saboteurs.

456
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,337
Immediately the neighbors came...

457
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,591
and took our food, the furniture
and then the house.

458
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,095
We stood on the street, in the freezing cold.

459
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:12,266
My mother was pregnant with eight children.

460
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:17,021
One of the neighbors took my pants off,

461
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,106
and I just stood there in my shirt.

462
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,568
Thank God, my older sister and
her husband sheltered us.

463
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,820
In a room in a dormitory for workers.

464
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:27,156
16 square meters for all of us together.

465
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,533
I had to sleep under the bed.

466
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,120
But so what, we survived.

467
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:36,415
Then came the war and all
men had to go to the front.

468
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:42,088
The others went to field hospitals
or to build factories or to study.

469
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:46,592
I wanted to learn so my mom sent
me to school. I was so proud.

470
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,386
Then I looked at my feet.

471
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:51,722
I stood in a puddle of ice and had no shoes.

472
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,101
But so what, we withstood, we survived!

473
00:39:55,851 --> 00:40:00,064
Then came the victory. But at what price?
All uncles, brothers had died.

474
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,484
That's how it was all over the
country in every family.

475
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:07,279
Sergey Pavlovich,
we have experienced so much.

476
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,241
Gone through so much.

477
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,495
Not to get scared of an emergency situation.

478
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,581
If the hatch gets stuck,
I'll gnaw a hole in it and crawl out.

479
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,132

I feel excellent.

571
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:13,028
Below me, I see clouds and the sea.

572

range of the Caucasus.

Remove the lens cap from the camera.

579
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:20,428
Finished! I have removed the lid!

580
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:22,139
What do I do with it now?

581
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:24,182
"Where do I put it"

582
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,145

So, now we only need to learn docking.

They ask to connect directly

Well then connect them!
- Connect them.
- Yes, sir.

Spatial orientation is normal.

634

So man can work in space.

635
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:04,754
Man can...

636
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,131

00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:32,740
Blood pressure and body temperature
have risen slightly. But otherwise...

647
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,703
his condition is stable.
- And the air supply?

648
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,830
That's enough for 27 minutes.

649
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:40,790
Then quickly to the next stage!

650
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:45,336
"Almaz-2"

651
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:48,131
Get ready for push off to test the
reaction of the vestibular system,

652
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:51,468
"the balance test in space"

653
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:15,033
Almaz-2, how are you?

654
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,452
"I feel great!"

655
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:20,079
I'm ready...

656
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:23,458
for the last gear and the photographs.

657
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:27,295
His blood pressure has suddenly
increased to 140 over 90.

658
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:31,257
Pulse 125. Body temperature 98.
- He is excited.

659
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,552
That would be everyone in his place.
- Almaz-2.

660
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:37,222
Take a few pictures and then home!

661
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,057
But without sudden movements.

662
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,517
"Nice and slow"

663
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,894
That's affirmative.

664
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:52,904
Pasha, are you smiling there?

665
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,240
I am.

666
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,326
Next photo.

667
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:01,496
"Time is running out.
Take some pictures and come back"

668
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:08,503
What's this?

669
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,213
What's with the pressure?

670
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:15,260
What's with the pressure?

671
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:38,700
Almaz-2, are you alright?

672
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,661
"Almaz, what's going on there?"

673
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,665
"Almaz-2 is not replying"

674
00:59:46,165 --> 00:59:48,376
"There was a blow to the ship's hull"

675
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:51,087
"Visual contact with Almaz-2 was lost"

676
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,965
What about the connection?

677
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:58,720
The devices are working well.
It is not a technical problem.

678
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:02,599
What is his condition?
- Blood pressure, pulse, temperature...
All are rising.

679
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:11,316
"Almaz, continue calling Almaz-2"

680
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,067
"I repeat: Almaz!"

681
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,111
Continue calling Almaz-2.

682
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,572
Everything went too well, too seamlessly.

683
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:20,742
Stop all on-air broadcasts.
- Yes, sir.

684
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:24,329
<i>We are presenting to the audience...

685
01:00:24,495 --> 01:00:27,707
<i>the ballet "The Stone Flower"
by Sergey Prokofiev,

686
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:30,376
<i>on stage at the State Academic
Bolshoi Theatre,

687
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:34,088
<i>where the Lenin Medal was awarded.

688
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,062
We'll wait.

689
01:00:58,112 --> 01:01:01,532
"Almaz-2, do you read me, over?"

690
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:10,541
Almaz-2, over?

691
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:15,004
"Zarya, I cannot connect with Almaz-2"

692
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,756
"I'll continue trying"

693
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:17,924
Sergey Pavlovich,

694
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:21,094
for such cases we have concrete instructions.

695
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:24,597
If Almaz-2 cannot get back to the ship...

696
01:01:24,764 --> 01:01:27,475
we have to get ready to blast off the airlock.

697
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,811
Blood pressure 155 over 100,

698
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:34,107
pulse 150, body temperature 101.

699
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:20,403
Zarya, this is Almaz.

700
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,697
Request for permission to enter the airlock.

701
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:29,912
How long until the dead zone?

702
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:32,498
Another 5 minutes until the connection aborts.
- Sergey Pavlovich.

703
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:37,086
The exit of the second cosmonaut means
the full depressurizing of the ship.

704
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:40,131
And they'll have to find their way back by themselves
because the connection will be lost.

705
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:44,927
And who knows how the spaceship
will behave in this case?

706
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:47,597
Start praying then.
- Sergey Pavlovich,

707
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:51,809
if we blast off the airlock,
only one cosmonaut will die.

708
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:53,519
If you give that order,

709
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:56,439
both could die.
- Almaz,

710
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:59,525
Prepare to depressurize the ship.

711
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:03,821
Copy, Zarya.

712
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:06,073
"2 minutes. Standby"

713
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,647
If Belyaev does not succeed,

714
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:41,734
the result of the colossal work of thousands
of Soviet citizens will stay in orbit.

715
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,653
At the moment I am only interested in these two.

716
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,905
"Zarya, this is Almaz"

717
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:49,659
I'm ready to go into the airlock.

718
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,578
Waiting for the order.
- We do not have the right...

719
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:55,456
to fail the whole space program for one man.

720
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:59,794
One minute until the dead zone!
- Cancel the command, Sergey Pavlovich!

721
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,879
What is the state of Almaz-2?

722
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:04,215
"Blood pressure 170 over 110,

723
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:08,511
pulse 165, body temperature 102"

724
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:10,596
He's alive.

725
01:04:10,763 --> 01:04:12,974
He's alive. Got it?

726
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,350
"Zarya, this is Almaz"

727
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:17,562
I repeat: I'm ready to go into the airlock.
Waiting for the order.

728
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:21,607
I hope you know what you are doing.

729
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:23,568
30 seconds until entering the dead zone.

730
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:32,785
"Zarya, I repeat,"

731
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:34,161
I'm waiting for the command.

732
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:36,998
Start depressurizing the ship.

733
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:38,291
15 seconds.

734
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:43,129
There he is! Almaz-2. Next to the airlock!

735
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:44,338
"Zarya, I confirm:"

736
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:46,883
Almaz-2 is next to the airlock.
- Almaz-2!

737
01:04:47,091 --> 01:04:49,510
Come back inside immediately!

738
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,099
They are in the dead zone.

739
01:04:58,519 --> 01:04:59,604
What happened?

740
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:04,150
"The spacesuit inflated.
Arms, legs, fingers...
I can hardly move"

741
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:05,151
Why didn't you answer?

742
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:07,361
Didn't want to bother you all.

743
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:09,906
"I see. Ok"

744
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:13,534
How much oxygen do I have?

745
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:15,953
Not much.

746
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:20,124
"Lyosha, hurry up"

747
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,252
Lyosha, there's no time at all.

748
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:25,171
"Take the camera and get into the ship!"

749
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:27,423
Ok, Ok... Taking the camera, Pasha.

750
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:28,925
Hurry up!

751
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:40,978
Well done.

752
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:49,570
"Got it. Now try"

753
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:52,573
That's the only way.

754
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:00,581
Come on!

755
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:02,750
What a mess.

756
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,085
Try again!

757
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,670
"Brace yourself, Lyosha!"

758
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:07,171
"Stop!"

759
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,673
Stop! Don't you dare!

760
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:10,549
"Only with the legs first!"

761
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:12,760
Close.

762
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:16,514
"Close! Close, I said!"

763
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:17,682
"Do it!"

764
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:32,071
It hasn't closed, right?

765
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:33,489
"No"

766
01:06:35,908 --> 01:06:40,079
"I see. Then I have to turn around
and close the hatch manually"

767
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:41,747
That won't work, Lyosha.

768
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:44,291
What is the alternative?

769
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:48,212
I'll open the hatch, pull you in...

770
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:49,839
"and depressurize the ship?"

771
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,215
So, we'll have to take the risk.

772
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:53,009
"And put the whole operation at risk?"

773
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:56,887
No, Pasha. I'll try again.

774
01:06:57,054 --> 01:06:57,972
"Lyosha!"

775
01:06:58,139 --> 01:06:59,432
Lyosha, no!

776
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:02,101
"Lyosha!"

777
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:04,103
Stop!

778
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,814
"You only had a little air before.
Now you won't have..."

779
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:07,857
anything at all.

780
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:10,317
Then you can eject me together
with the airlock.

781
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:11,694
You're bull-headed!

782
01:07:27,376 --> 01:07:29,378
Damn, I'm stuck!

783
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:31,797
I can't move!
- Lyosha, talk less.

784
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:33,507
"You're consuming too much oxygen"

785
01:07:33,674 --> 01:07:35,509
OK, I'm silent.

786
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:44,560
What if I put the leg... like this?

787
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:46,645
"Keep trying, go!"

788
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:51,692
Come on, Lyosha!

789
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:53,778
Go, go, go!

790
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:01,911
"Yes! The airlock is pressure-tight!"

791
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:05,206
"Now hold on for a few more minutes"

792
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,298
"Lyosha. Lyosha, no!"

793
01:09:14,441 --> 01:09:15,860
Lyosha!

794
01:09:19,446 --> 01:09:20,948
It's over.
- What?

795
01:09:22,032 --> 01:09:23,617
My race is over.

796
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:27,163
Good job, Lyosha.

797
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:50,144
Ok, I see, but can you tell us?

798
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:52,688
I understand, but what does it mean?

799
01:09:56,066 --> 01:09:57,551
Ok.

800
01:09:57,818 --> 01:09:59,153
Thank you.

801
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:05,743
They say the flight is proceeding as planned.

802
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:09,496
Lyosha always answers like that,
if he gets disturbed at work...

803
01:10:10,414 --> 01:10:12,541
or if the situation is bad.

804
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:24,762
In Moscow and Leningrad
there were demonstrations...

805
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:26,847
in honor of the pilots.

806
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:32,561
Svetlana Leonova called.
- Tea?
- No, thank you.

807
01:10:33,437 --> 01:10:34,980
She wanted to know what's going on.

808
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:36,899
She is worried.
- Why is she worried?

809
01:10:37,107 --> 01:10:38,651
Everything is fine.

810
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:40,986
Voskhod 2 is going to escape
the dead zone in a minute.

811
01:10:41,195 --> 01:10:42,738
Start calling.

812
01:11:09,014 --> 01:11:10,391
Lyosha?

813
01:11:13,143 --> 01:11:14,353
Lyosha, come back to earth!

814
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:16,647
Almaz-2!

815
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:18,732
We are escaping the dead zone.

816
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:22,444
Hey, I was thinking...

817
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,697
next time,

818
01:11:25,447 --> 01:11:28,200
when we fly to the moon ...
- Command Center is on the line.

819
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:30,995
Get ready for a scolding.

820
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:33,664
"Almaz, this is Zarya"

821
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:35,332
"do you read me?"

822
01:11:35,499 --> 01:11:37,918
Zarya, this is Almaz,
reading you loud and clear.

823
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:41,380
Almaz, what is with Almaz-2?

824
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:43,340
Zarya, this is Almaz-2...

825
01:11:43,507 --> 01:11:44,550
"reading you loud and clear also"

826
01:11:44,925 --> 01:11:46,802
What a rascal!

827
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:53,559
Almaz-2,

828
01:11:53,767 --> 01:11:57,563
"Welcome back! Thank you for your service!"

829
01:12:00,524 --> 01:12:02,609
Thank you. Proud to serve to the Soviet...

830
01:12:02,776 --> 01:12:03,819
"Why the hell..."

831
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,571
didn't you answer?

832
01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:15,414
Zarya, we had some problems with the connection.
We could not find the cause.

833
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:16,790
"Almaz-2,"

834
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,460
"you can't answer for yourself?"

835
01:12:19,626 --> 01:12:20,836
I confirm.

836
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:24,423
Zarya, everything is alright here.
We are ready to blast-off the airlock.

837
01:12:24,798 --> 01:12:26,425
"Get ready..."

838
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:28,218
"to blast off the airlock!"

839
01:12:28,385 --> 01:12:30,220
Getting ready to blast off the airlock.

840
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:31,847
"Again as a reminder..."

841
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:35,976
"that we implemented the test cycle
only until this stage"

842
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:38,854
"We don't know what can happen after
blasting off the airlock"

843
01:12:39,146 --> 01:12:41,774
Be ready for anything and everything.

844
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:44,401
It can't get any worse.

845
01:12:45,944 --> 01:12:49,448
"Almaz, check the pressure in the cabin"

846
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:51,533
The pressure in the cabin is normal.

847
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,911
"Check the contact of the igniters"

848
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:56,330
Check. Ready to blast off the airlock.

849
01:12:58,707 --> 01:12:59,750
Blast off!

850
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:18,143
Zarya, blasting the airlock is complete.

851
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:21,105
No pressure loss or other problems.

852
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:23,315
But we turned.

853
01:13:25,692 --> 01:13:28,779
How far have you turned, Almaz?

854
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:30,364
"I would say..."

855
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:32,408
"around 20 degrees"

856
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:35,828
The automatic control system
could stabilize the ship.

857
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:39,373
But that would consume all the fuel
intended for manual landing.

858
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:42,918
Sergey Pavlovich, I'll put my
neck on the line for the automation.

859
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:44,670
The manual landing won't be necessary.

860
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:51,260
Almaz's, how do you feel?

861
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:55,264
We feel good, Zarya.

862
01:13:56,348 --> 01:13:57,850
Well then...

863
01:13:59,184 --> 01:14:00,436
Let's go for a spin.

864
01:14:00,894 --> 01:14:03,814
"It's 15 orbits before
entering the landing zone"

865
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:06,733
"That's about 22 hours"

866
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:08,277
"What do you think, can you endure that?"

867
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:10,946
We will, Zarya.

868
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:13,240
"Hold on, my eagles"

869
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:15,117
"Hold on"

870
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:18,245
22 hours...

871
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:21,248
That's like going to Tuapse by train

872
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:24,877
riding in the upper berth.

873
01:14:54,364 --> 01:14:56,283
20TH HOUR OF FLIGHT

874
01:14:56,450 --> 01:15:00,621
TWO HOURS UNTIL ACTIVATING AUTOMATIC LANDING

875
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:49,545
You should sleep a bit.
There are ten more orbits.

876
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:55,217
Later. I need to finish the drawing.
Tretyakov Gallery is waitng.

877
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:57,536
The Tretyakov Gallery?
- What did you think?

878
01:15:57,803 --> 01:16:00,681
The first picture that was drawn in space.

879
01:16:00,847 --> 01:16:04,142
This isn't just a drawing of flowers in pots.

880
01:16:05,018 --> 01:16:08,522
They will hang it right next to
"Morning in a Pine Forest".

881
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:12,484
Do you know they called me to go to the art Academy?
They kept me a place until the last moment.

882
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:15,153
Why didn't you go?
- What for?

883
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,781
You can fly and paint.

884
01:16:17,948 --> 01:16:20,075
But paint and fly... It's unlikely.

885
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:23,370
Well... They called me to visit Cuba.

886
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:28,000
You?
- Yeah, they called me right from
the embassy to the ship.

887
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:32,462
I was congratulated. "Come here," they said,
"Pavel Ivanovich, for holidays."

888
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:36,174
Ah... But where was I?
- I don't know, you went somewhere.

889
01:16:36,341 --> 01:16:37,884
Right.

890
01:16:38,051 --> 01:16:40,971
Brezhnev congratulated me at the same time.

891
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:45,100
He said he will come to the airport to meet me.

892
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:49,271
"Lyosha," he said, "Just when you descend
the ladder, look to the left,"

893
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:51,690
"you'll recognize me, by my hat."

894
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:57,529
Then were going to the country.
No, to the Kremlin first.
Then to the country.

895
01:16:58,739 --> 01:17:01,450
I wish you would draw instead, Lyosha.

896
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:19,009
Lyosha...

897
01:17:21,553 --> 01:17:23,764
Lyosha!
- What is it?

898
01:17:24,389 --> 01:17:28,477
How do you feel? Everything Ok?
- Yeah, just a little bit queasy.

899
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:30,771
But that's normal.

900
01:17:31,938 --> 01:17:34,191
How much oxygen do we have?
- One moment.

901
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:37,653
No way.

902
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,493
Almost three hundred. Call.

903
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:50,082
Zarya, this is Almaz.

904
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:53,418
"Our oxygen content is twice above normal"

905
01:17:53,585 --> 01:17:55,212
What's the exact value?

906
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:57,964
296... and still climbing.

907
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:00,425
Almaz's...

908
01:18:00,592 --> 01:18:03,637
No sudden movements. This is not air...

909
01:18:03,804 --> 01:18:05,305
"but pure oxygen"

910
01:18:05,472 --> 01:18:08,016
"The littlest spark and you'll burn instantly"

911
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:09,226
Copy.

912
01:18:10,602 --> 01:18:11,603
What should we do?

913
01:18:11,895 --> 01:18:16,066
Turn off the main lights.
Stand by for instructions.

914
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:18,485
Copy.

915
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:24,991
Where is the oxygen coming from?

916
01:18:27,411 --> 01:18:28,912
They'll find out.

917
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:31,707
There is a leak somewhere.
- Maybe from the backpacks.

918
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:34,626
Leonov left his in the airlock,
so..., it's Belyaev's?

919
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:38,046
And the value reached 296 at once?
Because of just one backpack?

920
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:40,465
Then it's from one of the oxygen compensators.

921
01:18:40,674 --> 01:18:44,845
But there aren't any failures in the system
and the capsule is tight and undamaged.

922
01:18:45,011 --> 01:18:48,974
Maybe the hatch shifted away during the blast off?

923
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:53,437
But then we would see a drastic temperature drop.
- Comrades,

924
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:55,731
their pulse and blood pressure are decreasing.

925
01:18:55,897 --> 01:18:57,941
The risk of oxygen poisoning is extremely high.

926
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:01,069
We need a blueprint of the central ceiling zone.

927
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:02,654
The most detailed.

928
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:10,120
Almaz, most likely there is...

929
01:19:10,287 --> 01:19:14,750
"a micro fissure. It's useless trying to
search for it, it's not dangerous by itself"

930
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:19,880
"But the system has detected the leak
and automatically started pumping oxygen"

931
01:19:20,046 --> 01:19:22,841
"The compensation detector can only
be turned off manually"

932
01:19:23,049 --> 01:19:24,718
"You'll have to disassemble something"

933
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:28,930
Copy.
- Sergey Pavlovich! We must not do it!
Everything is under voltage there.

934
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:32,434
Do you have a better idea?
Almaz,

935
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:35,353
"in the middle of the ceiling right above you,"

936
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,106
"the compensation leakage detector..."

937
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:41,902
"is next to the pressure relief valve"

938
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:46,907
"You have to cut open the panel"

939
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:49,409
This is a gamble.
Remember...

940
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:54,372
during assemblage, a technician died.
And he was a qualified specialist.

941
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:05,091
Do you see the density of wiring?

942
01:20:05,258 --> 01:20:07,552
And they have neither tools nor light.

943
01:20:08,887 --> 01:20:10,347
My God.

944
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:15,435
Zarya, we've cut the panel.

945
01:20:15,602 --> 01:20:17,813
"The sensor system is behind the cables"

946
01:20:18,438 --> 01:20:23,527
"To get to it, you need to cut
the binding holding the wires"

947
01:20:23,693 --> 01:20:25,111
Copy, Zarya.

948
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,447
Lyosha, shine it here.

949
01:20:28,114 --> 01:20:29,241
What will happen to them?

950
01:20:29,699 --> 01:20:31,493
Numbness of the limbs at the beginning.

951
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:35,580
Then painful muscle cramps.

952
01:20:35,747 --> 01:20:40,001
All of that amid a background of partial
hearing loss and visual hallucinations.

953
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:44,881
Stop! Easy... Easy...

954
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:48,301
Hold on, hold on...

955
01:20:49,719 --> 01:20:51,680
Carefully.

956
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:55,892
Let me do it.

957
01:20:56,476 --> 01:20:57,894
And you hold the light.

958
01:20:58,186 --> 01:21:00,772
Finally, they will fall asleep.

959
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:03,400
Fall asleep? That's all?

960
01:21:04,901 --> 01:21:06,236
Exactly.

961
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:08,488
That's all.

962
01:21:09,239 --> 01:21:10,156
Almaz,

963
01:21:10,782 --> 01:21:12,242
I'll do it.

964
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:15,370
"Almaz, do you hear me?"

965
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:18,582
Hold on. Hold on, Pasha.

966
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:21,668
"Almaz!"

967
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:23,461
"Do do you hear me?"

968
01:21:28,091 --> 01:21:29,426
"Almaz!"

969
01:21:31,094 --> 01:21:32,637
"Almaz, do you hear me?"

970
01:21:32,804 --> 01:21:35,223
Pasha, you're shining the light so well.

971
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:38,810
Evenly...so bright.

972
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:43,690
Good. That's good.

973
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:45,483
Zarya,

974
01:21:47,152 --> 01:21:49,487
I have visual. I have visual.

975
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,033
I can see the sensor.

976
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:55,410
"Very good! Now comes the important thing"

977
01:21:57,704 --> 01:21:59,873
"Do you see the yellow cable?"

978
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:03,460
"Unplug it. It's behind the nest of wires"

979
01:22:04,961 --> 01:22:07,672
"Do you hear me? Reply"

980
01:22:07,839 --> 01:22:09,215
Zarya, repeat.

981
01:22:09,382 --> 01:22:11,176
"Behind the nest of wires"

982
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:12,344
Repeat, Zarya!

983
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:15,847
"Unplug the yellow.. behind the nest of wires"

984
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:19,100
"Do you hear me?"

985
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:20,435
The nest.

986
01:22:21,978 --> 01:22:23,980
So that's where it lives.

987
01:22:24,147 --> 01:22:25,815
"I did not understand you, Almaz"

988
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:28,276
That's where it sleeps.
That's her house.

989
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:30,445
"What house?"

990
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:34,366
"I did not understand you Almaz. Repeat"

991
01:22:34,532 --> 01:22:35,867
We'll unplug it.

992
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:36,952
"Do you have it?"

993
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:38,078
Where is your house?

994
01:22:40,246 --> 01:22:41,831
"Have you unplugged it? Almaz?"

995
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:47,295
Ok, I've found it.

996
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:53,301
Hold on, Pasha.

997
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:08,858
"Almaz!"

998
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:12,487
"Almaz, do you hear me?"

999
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:19,786
"Don't be silent, speak!
Have you unplugged it? Almaz!"

1000
01:23:28,378 --> 01:23:31,631
"Almaz, Come in please!"

1001
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,063
Almaz, Almaz...

1002
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:50,400
There is no signal anymore.
They are in the dead zone.

1003
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:54,571
The system of automatic orientation...

1004
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:59,075
will run before escaping the dead zone.
Cycle 4 will bring them down safely.

1005
01:24:02,954 --> 01:24:05,123
Do they have a chance?

1006
01:24:34,527 --> 01:24:35,945
Mama?
- Yes?

1007
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:40,325
Is it night in space too?

1008
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:42,952
Yes. Go to sleep.

1009
01:24:45,538 --> 01:24:47,874
Is papa sleeping now too?

1010
01:24:49,292 --> 01:24:51,127
Certainly.

1011
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:54,923
We all have to sleep.

1012
01:25:04,015 --> 01:25:05,934
When I wake up,

1013
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:09,562
will papa have landed then?

1014
01:25:13,608 --> 01:25:15,318
He will try.

1015
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:21,366
He will try very hard.

1016
01:26:43,239 --> 01:26:44,741
22ND HOUR OF FLIGHT

1017
01:26:45,158 --> 01:26:49,287
25 MINUTES AFTER ACTIVATION
OF THE AUTOMATC LANDING

1018
01:26:58,296 --> 01:27:03,384
We've been waiting for a signal,
but it's been silent.
There is no visual contact either.

1019
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:05,511
Disgusting.

1020
01:27:06,846 --> 01:27:09,891
A crowd of strong healthy men
sitting like couch potatoes.

1021
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:12,602
And sighing like it's a funeral.

1022
01:27:13,519 --> 01:27:16,814
If we cannot help our comrades...

1023
01:27:16,981 --> 01:27:20,360
we can at least not hold a premature funeral!

1024
01:27:20,568 --> 01:27:23,947
Please, coffee for everybody. And me too.
Strong coffee.

1025
01:27:24,530 --> 01:27:27,408
Look, let's think logically.

1026
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:30,245
The ship should have landed 23 minutes ago.

1027
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:33,831
Perhaps during the re-entry into
the atmosphere it went off course...

1028
01:27:33,998 --> 01:27:36,417
and it ended up in an unplanned area.

1029
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:39,462
You're repeating yourself, Boris Viktorovich.

1030
01:27:39,629 --> 01:27:41,506
"Probably, perhaps, it seems..."

1031
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:45,802
Give me the calculations for all landing possibilities.

1032
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:49,097
Copy. Prepare the calculations.
- We are running out of time.

1033
01:27:49,764 --> 01:27:52,892
Let's send some aircraft to
search from the air.

1034
01:27:53,059 --> 01:27:56,187
Sergey Pavlovich, there is a call from Kremlin.
They want to congratulate the successful...

1035
01:27:56,354 --> 01:27:58,982
They will call back.
- Their parameters!

1036
01:28:00,316 --> 01:28:03,194
They are alive! They are alive!

1037
01:28:03,653 --> 01:28:06,322
We have contact again!
- Signal, there is a signal!

1038
01:28:07,907 --> 01:28:10,285
"This is Almaz, over"

1039
01:28:10,451 --> 01:28:12,870
Tell them, Korolyov left to
meet the cosmonauts.

1040
01:28:13,037 --> 01:28:14,998
Almaz! We're here.

1041
01:28:15,707 --> 01:28:17,208
We can hear you.

1042
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:19,794
We are you? We are you, Eagles?

1043
01:28:20,086 --> 01:28:23,214
In our seats, we didn't go anywhere.

1044
01:28:23,381 --> 01:28:25,383
Zarya, this is Almaz.

1045
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:28,469
We're fine.

1046
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:30,638
But Cycle 4 has not been activated.

1047
01:28:31,264 --> 01:28:34,100
"I repeat, Cycle 4 has not been activated"

1048
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:38,938
"We are still in orbit and have
just left the dead zone"

1049
01:28:39,105 --> 01:28:42,275
Sergey Pavlovich, I can not explain it.

1050
01:28:42,442 --> 01:28:44,944
Perhaps, the spin of the ship was too strong.

1051
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:47,238
This is an extraordinary situation.

1052
01:28:47,447 --> 01:28:50,074
Oh, is it really? It's not the first
time you could not explain it?

1053
01:28:50,241 --> 01:28:52,452
Has anyone counted?
- I did!

1054
01:28:56,706 --> 01:29:00,209
Try to restart the system.
- Restart is being prepared.

1055
01:29:00,376 --> 01:29:02,920
Land them in the next orbit.

1056
01:29:03,629 --> 01:29:06,674
We don't have a right to land them in the next orbit.

1057
01:29:06,841 --> 01:29:09,552
The ship will be passing in rival territory.

1058
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:12,055
The boys should be returned to Earth.

1059
01:29:12,221 --> 01:29:14,265
We'll take care of the area later.

1060
01:29:14,432 --> 01:29:15,850
"Zarya, this is Almaz"

1061
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:20,313
Permission to switch the ship
to manual control immediately...

1062
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:23,441
and implement the landing
right now, over.

1063
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:28,321
"Almaz, we need to calculate the
landing point for that. We don't
have enough time for that now"

1064
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:32,241
Sergey Pavlovich! Don't worry!
We have all the calculations.

1065
01:29:32,408 --> 01:29:34,702
So, I guesstimated here...

1066
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:38,915
We'll land in the Urals.
Somewhere in the Perm area. 
- Lyosha,

1067
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:41,376
Be reasonable. Is that calculations?

1068
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:43,795
"He guesstimated somewhere in the Perm area."

1069
01:29:44,420 --> 01:29:47,465
On the other hand, they both
are experienced pilots.

1070
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:52,053
But nobody ever landed a
spaceship in manual mode.

1071
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:56,808
Manual control, it's like, I don't know...
a straw for a drowning.

1072
01:29:57,016 --> 01:30:00,311
Exclusively only for desperate situations.

1073
01:30:00,937 --> 01:30:03,606
And what is the situation now?
- Sergey Pavlovich,

1074
01:30:04,148 --> 01:30:06,025
One minute please.

1075
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:08,027
That's it.

1076
01:30:09,612 --> 01:30:11,155
The meeting has begun.

1077
01:30:13,449 --> 01:30:15,535
Now they will gather everyone.

1078
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:19,288
Then they will appoint a chairman.

1079
01:30:19,872 --> 01:30:23,501
Then they will listen to a speaker
and then they will begin to argue.

1080
01:30:24,293 --> 01:30:28,423
And you asked me why I didn't reply?
I would be dead by now.

1081
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:34,595
Come on, we will land this clunker, Pash.

1082
01:30:34,762 --> 01:30:37,473
We landed a lot worse rust buckets in our day.

1083
01:30:38,141 --> 01:30:39,851
You will land it, won't you?

1084
01:30:43,479 --> 01:30:46,190
We don't have any other option.
- Why not?

1085
01:30:46,816 --> 01:30:50,736
Either we land manually
or they will leave us in orbit.

1086
01:30:56,826 --> 01:30:59,412
In short we do as we are told to do.

1087
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:05,251
You think they won't permit it?

1088
01:31:07,753 --> 01:31:09,547
I wouldn't.

1089
01:31:09,797 --> 01:31:13,134
We are not sisters of mercy, Sergey Pavlovich.

1090
01:31:13,384 --> 01:31:17,221
State secrets are not subjects for experiments.

1091
01:31:17,388 --> 01:31:19,974
Honestly, I don't understand you.

1092
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:24,687
Or maybe I do, but that's even worse.

1093
01:31:24,854 --> 01:31:27,899
Are you proposing to keep them in orbit?

1094
01:31:28,608 --> 01:31:31,444
Did I get you right?
- We are at war.

1095
01:31:31,611 --> 01:31:35,781
Cold, but quite real.
What if they land in Europe?

1096
01:31:36,073 --> 01:31:37,783
Or, God forbid, fly into China.

1097
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:41,454
All the secrets of our space program
will fall into the hands of the enemy.

1098
01:31:41,621 --> 01:31:45,416
And why should they die?
As a precaution? If it goes wrong?

1099
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:49,712
So they do not land somewhere
where they should not land?
- They are soldiers.

1100
01:31:49,879 --> 01:31:54,467
And soldiers have to be ready to die
in the interest of their state.
- I see.

1101
01:31:55,635 --> 01:31:57,470
Ok, well...

1102
01:31:57,637 --> 01:31:59,472
The idea is not new,

1103
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:02,141
but constructive. Thank you. Many Thanks.

1104
01:32:02,683 --> 01:32:05,603
I'll have to think about it.

1105
01:32:18,241 --> 01:32:19,325
Almaz!

1106
01:32:20,076 --> 01:32:21,744
"This is Zarya"

1107
01:32:22,578 --> 01:32:25,081
"Switch to..."

1108
01:32:30,169 --> 01:32:31,504
manual control.

1109
01:32:31,671 --> 01:32:35,216
"Start making your spacesuits pressure resistant"

1110
01:32:35,633 --> 01:32:38,719
Zarya, copy that.
Making spacesuits pressure resistant.

1111
01:32:38,886 --> 01:32:41,389
It's good that you're not
the one who decides.

1112
01:32:49,772 --> 01:32:52,692
Zarya, I repeat, the
landing area is approximately...

1113
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:54,610
Lyosha, they can't hear you.

1114
01:32:54,777 --> 01:32:57,071
They'll find us somehow.
If we land.

1115
01:32:57,238 --> 01:32:59,991
I say we land right on Red Square.
- Enough talk,

1116
01:33:00,741 --> 01:33:02,326
start stabilization of the spaceship.

1117
01:33:26,559 --> 01:33:30,271
Looks like we're in position.
- See! You can do it when you want to.

1118
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:33,190
All we need now is to make it to Earth.

1119
01:33:36,569 --> 01:33:37,612
Lyosha.

1120
01:33:39,363 --> 01:33:40,865
I'm crammed in.

1121
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:44,035
And how... how am I supposed to see?

1122
01:33:45,244 --> 01:33:46,704
Maybe I should go out?

1123
01:33:50,082 --> 01:33:51,500
You direct me.

1124
01:33:52,793 --> 01:33:53,794
I'm ready!

1125
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:57,006
To the west.
- Done.

1126
01:33:58,466 --> 01:34:00,009
To the southwest.

1127
01:34:01,177 --> 01:34:01,969
Done.

1128
01:34:03,220 --> 01:34:05,806
North.
- Done.
- No, no! Northwest.

1129
01:34:06,015 --> 01:34:08,684
North or Northwest?
- Easy, easy, easy...

1130
01:34:09,143 --> 01:34:10,394
And now in a clockwise direction.

1131
01:34:15,149 --> 01:34:17,485
Gently.

1132
01:34:21,322 --> 01:34:22,615
And now west.
- Done.

1133
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:24,408
Too much! Back it up!

1134
01:34:24,617 --> 01:34:26,494
Stop! Stop! Start over.

1135
01:34:29,705 --> 01:34:31,040
Ready.

1136
01:34:31,582 --> 01:34:33,376
West.

1137
01:34:33,542 --> 01:34:34,293
West!

1138
01:34:36,545 --> 01:34:39,882
Pasha, we're losing time.
- That won't work, Lyosh. I'll do it myself.

1139
01:34:40,049 --> 01:34:41,801
What are you doing?
The gravity center will shift.

1140
01:34:42,009 --> 01:34:43,761
Get up from your seat.

1141
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:47,723
And where should I go now?

1142
01:34:48,099 --> 01:34:49,725
Go there, under the porthole.

1143
01:34:50,142 --> 01:34:51,227
I'll try to.

1144
01:34:52,269 --> 01:34:53,813
Ok, hold my legs.

1145
01:34:54,105 --> 01:34:55,606
I'm holding.

1146
01:34:57,733 --> 01:34:58,818
Lyosha, I'll take aim.

1147
01:34:59,944 --> 01:35:05,616
And we'll very carefully...
gently as little mice...
sit back in our seats.

1148
01:35:05,825 --> 01:35:09,036
Do it quick, buddy.
Otherwise we'll land in China.
- Don't rush me.

1149
01:35:10,162 --> 01:35:13,374
If I slip up, we'll fly into space.

1150
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:34,562
Easy. Back to the seats.

1151
01:35:57,752 --> 01:35:59,295
Are we still on course?

1152
01:36:00,171 --> 01:36:01,839
We shifted.
- How much?

1153
01:36:02,047 --> 01:36:04,884
About 7 degrees already.
- Damn it. And the nitrogen indicator?

1154
01:36:05,468 --> 01:36:06,719
It's almost zero.

1155
01:36:08,137 --> 01:36:09,764
Lyosha, are you wearing your seatbelt?

1156
01:36:27,907 --> 01:36:30,409
The navigation system has been activated.

1157
01:36:30,576 --> 01:36:32,828
It'd be great to know
where they will end up...

1158
01:36:33,579 --> 01:36:37,291
We'll end up in jail, if anything.
But they will land.

1159
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:39,460
The meter indicates a tilt.

1160
01:36:39,627 --> 01:36:42,463
I seems they left their seats,
to be able to navigate better.

1161
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:45,382
And when they sat back,
the gravity center shifted.

1162
01:36:45,591 --> 01:36:46,926
What does that mean?

1163
01:36:47,092 --> 01:36:50,805
That their trajectory could change.
- Sergey Pavlovich, may I?

1164
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:54,016
With the inclination over...

1165
01:36:54,391 --> 01:36:56,060
by six or seven degrees,

1166
01:36:56,727 --> 01:36:59,897
they will get into the atmosphere
at a very acute angle.

1167
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:02,358
The spaceship might ricochet off
and be thrown back into orbit.

1168
01:37:02,525 --> 01:37:07,530
Gravity will pull them back
down eventually.

1169
01:37:07,696 --> 01:37:10,783
But that won't be soon.
Boris Viktorovich,

1170
01:37:10,991 --> 01:37:13,744
calculate all possible landing positions.

1171
01:37:13,911 --> 01:37:15,162
Stay focused.

1172
01:37:15,454 --> 01:37:16,622
Let's wait...

1173
01:37:17,748 --> 01:37:19,959
for the transmitter signal...

1174
01:37:20,668 --> 01:37:24,463
and hope... for the best.

1175
01:37:38,686 --> 01:37:40,354
Is it Thursday?

1176
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:42,398
Or Friday?

1177
01:37:43,274 --> 01:37:44,942
I have no idea.

1178
01:37:47,278 --> 01:37:49,530
You think the children have got up?

1179
01:37:52,116 --> 01:37:54,076
I wonder if Vika will go to kindergarten today...

1180
01:37:55,703 --> 01:37:57,538
or if she has a cold again?

1181
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:03,252
Lyosha, don't worry.

1182
01:38:03,669 --> 01:38:06,088
If I slipped up, then in about three years...

1183
01:38:06,255 --> 01:38:08,424
gravity will bring us down.

1184
01:38:08,591 --> 01:38:10,676
We'll be buried with honours.

1185
01:38:18,017 --> 01:38:19,393
So...

1186
01:38:21,937 --> 01:38:23,314
Let's eat something.

1187
01:38:29,194 --> 01:38:32,239
How about that! What delicacies!

1188
01:38:35,534 --> 01:38:36,744
Borscht.

1189
01:38:38,621 --> 01:38:40,080
It's a pity there's no garlic.

1190
01:38:48,714 --> 01:38:50,215
Do you want some?

1191
01:39:00,267 --> 01:39:01,727
Lyosha!

1192
01:39:06,482 --> 01:39:07,441
Seems...

1193
01:39:07,441 --> 01:39:08,400
we have gravity.

1194
01:39:10,027 --> 01:39:13,030
Hold the delicacies!
We're going home!

1195
01:39:14,031 --> 01:39:16,116
Understood, Comrade Commander!

1196
01:39:26,961 --> 01:39:28,128
Blasting off reserve retro engine.

1197
01:39:31,715 --> 01:39:33,342
Separation confirmed.

1198
01:39:34,093 --> 01:39:36,220
Get ready for instrument module
separation blast off!

1199
01:39:40,265 --> 01:39:42,851
Partial, the module hasn't been separated.

1200
01:39:43,018 --> 01:39:44,895
Lyosha, hold on! It's going to spin.

1201
01:40:29,481 --> 01:40:32,234
Ok! Ok! It came apart!

1202
01:42:04,743 --> 01:42:06,203
Are alive?

1203
01:42:09,873 --> 01:42:11,041
Pasha?

1204
01:42:22,010 --> 01:42:23,470
Pasha...
- I'm still alive!

1205
01:42:23,637 --> 01:42:25,180
You fool!

1206
01:42:25,639 --> 01:42:28,183
Were you scared?
- Why'd you do that?

1207
01:42:28,350 --> 01:42:30,394
Done?
- Yeah.

1208
01:42:34,231 --> 01:42:35,732
Let's go.

1209
01:42:36,859 --> 01:42:39,444
Ready? It will be loud.

1210
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:41,405
Wait a sec.

1211
01:43:02,259 --> 01:43:04,720
So are you ready?
- Yeah.

1212
01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:05,090
THREE HOURS AFTER LANDING

1213
01:45:10,595 --> 01:45:14,182
"This is Alpha 18. I did not receive a signal"

1214
01:45:14,349 --> 01:45:18,645
"The search in section 28 is finished"

1215
01:45:18,812 --> 01:45:22,733
"No traces of a landing"

1216
01:45:22,899 --> 01:45:25,360
"We are at section 24, no signal"

1217
01:45:25,527 --> 01:45:28,572
"Section 22, still nothing"

1218
01:45:28,739 --> 01:45:32,159
"In the entire short-wave range, no signal"

1219
01:45:33,076 --> 01:45:35,120
"Continue searching"

1220
01:45:35,537 --> 01:45:36,830
Why the hell can't we...

1221
01:45:37,414 --> 01:45:39,916
with all the achievements of Soviet science...

1222
01:45:40,125 --> 01:45:43,003
detect even a single transmitter
in a particular area?

1223
01:45:44,588 --> 01:45:47,299
The signal disappeared during re-entry
into the atmosphere.

1224
01:45:47,466 --> 01:45:49,843
That could mean...
- Not "could!"

1225
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:52,346
I want specific details.

1226
01:45:53,555 --> 01:45:54,931
Sergey Pavlovich,

1227
01:45:55,849 --> 01:45:58,769
Apparently, they landed somewhere
that we didn't expect.

1228
01:45:58,935 --> 01:46:01,855
A full-scaled search operation
has been deployed.

1229
01:46:02,189 --> 01:46:05,650
You need to calm down, and get some rest.

1230
01:46:05,859 --> 01:46:07,652
I'll get rest when we've found them.

1231
01:46:07,819 --> 01:46:09,571
Does anyone have any thoughts?

1232
01:46:10,197 --> 01:46:11,573
First possibility,

1233
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:15,035
the beacon might be broken
from a hard landing.

1234
01:46:15,202 --> 01:46:18,830
Second, they might have damaged it
when they were cutting the upholstery.

1235
01:46:18,997 --> 01:46:22,876
They have a portable transmitter for
that case to send signals manually.

1236
01:46:23,085 --> 01:46:25,420
So why can't we detect it?

1237
01:46:25,629 --> 01:46:28,173
The batteries of the transmitter
do not work at low temperatures.

1238
01:46:28,382 --> 01:46:30,425
So what? It wouldn't dawn upon them
how to warm a battery?

1239
01:46:30,634 --> 01:46:33,011
First they would have to work
out how to warm themselves.

1240
01:46:33,303 --> 01:46:36,890
The spacesuits, unplugged from the life support
system, are not designed for low temperatures.

1241
01:46:37,057 --> 01:46:40,685
Also they cannot take shelter in the capsule.
It will be like a freezer in an hour.

1242
01:46:40,852 --> 01:46:44,356
Perhaps, the radio waves just cannot pass through.

1243
01:46:44,523 --> 01:46:48,735
The quality of a short-wave signal depends a lot
on the terrain and weather conditions.

1244
01:46:48,902 --> 01:46:50,862
Let's assume,

1245
01:46:51,029 --> 01:46:53,323
they turned out to be
in adverse weather conditions.

1246
01:46:54,574 --> 01:46:56,410
How long can they last?

1247
01:46:57,911 --> 01:46:59,204
A day.

1248
01:47:16,847 --> 01:47:19,599
This forest. It's blocking the signal.

1249
01:47:21,601 --> 01:47:22,853
But we can use Morse code.

1250
01:47:23,562 --> 01:47:25,856
We'll make it with good old Morse code.

1251
01:47:27,691 --> 01:47:30,277
Morse code is very reliable.

1252
01:47:30,986 --> 01:47:33,989
You'd better warm up, Alexey.

1253
01:47:34,781 --> 01:47:36,074
I'll be ok.

1254
01:48:40,055 --> 01:48:42,474
B-H... B-H, B-H, B-H.

1255
01:48:42,641 --> 01:48:45,435
What's does that mean, "B-H, B-H?"

1256
01:48:45,810 --> 01:48:47,020
Equals...?

1257
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:51,441
Equals...?

1258
01:48:54,236 --> 01:48:58,532
Oh, "Everything normal".
- Do you mind?

1259
01:48:58,698 --> 01:49:02,410
They've landed, our eagles! B-H!
- What?
- It's B-H! "Everything normal"!

1260
01:49:02,619 --> 01:49:04,246
So everything is normal?
- Wait!

1261
01:49:04,454 --> 01:49:06,998
It's just starting to become interesting.
A rescue operation.

1262
01:49:07,165 --> 01:49:08,708
Don't worry, they will rescue them without you.

1263
01:49:10,377 --> 01:49:13,046
They will show everything on TV tomorrow.
- Ahh, why do you always...

1264
01:49:13,213 --> 01:49:16,716
Go, go. Enough intercepting state secrets.

1265
01:49:24,349 --> 01:49:25,433
The Kremlin...

1266
01:49:26,434 --> 01:49:28,353
...is waiting for an official statement.

1267
01:49:29,396 --> 01:49:32,315
We have to do it tomorrow by 10 AM.

1268
01:49:32,649 --> 01:49:35,026
We have nothing to say yet.

1269
01:49:43,702 --> 01:49:44,953
Sergey Pavlovich,

1270
01:49:45,537 --> 01:49:47,539
You need to rest.

1271
01:49:47,706 --> 01:49:49,374
Nothing depends on you now.

1272
01:49:49,541 --> 01:49:53,628
There is a plenty of time until the morning,
if we don't waste it.

1273
01:49:54,254 --> 01:49:56,590
Comrade lieutenant general! Permission to speak.

1274
01:49:56,756 --> 01:50:00,260
The weather report has come. Heavy snowfall
is expected all over the Ural ridge.

1275
01:50:00,635 --> 01:50:02,345
An arctic storm is moving in.

1276
01:50:02,512 --> 01:50:05,265
The temperature will fall to -31 F at night.

1277
01:50:05,432 --> 01:50:06,683
At night?

1278
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:10,061
But it's still day now, right?

1279
01:50:13,023 --> 01:50:15,358
It's still day.

1280
01:50:16,818 --> 01:50:19,696
SIX HOURS AFTER LANDING

1281
01:50:22,324 --> 01:50:25,535
If they got the signal,
they'll need about two hours.

1282
01:50:25,702 --> 01:50:28,038
That means they will be here soon.

1283
01:50:28,204 --> 01:50:30,665
They'll be here soon. Soon.

1284
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:33,043
If they got it.

1285
01:50:38,965 --> 01:50:40,175
Here.

1286
01:50:40,967 --> 01:50:42,344
It's your turn.

1287
01:50:44,554 --> 01:50:48,892
Relax. We knew what we were getting into.

1288
01:50:53,438 --> 01:50:55,315
If they find the logbook,

1289
01:50:55,899 --> 01:50:58,360
the mission will be completed.

1290
01:50:58,902 --> 01:51:01,112
What do you mean "completed"?

1291
01:51:01,279 --> 01:51:02,864
Did you forget about your girls?

1292
01:51:05,241 --> 01:51:07,494
They're ironing your uniform right now...

1293
01:51:07,661 --> 01:51:09,913
preparing to meet their father alive.

1294
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,956
You understand? Alive.

1295
01:51:12,749 --> 01:51:16,002
Not a frozen piece of mammoth shit.

1296
01:51:16,169 --> 01:51:17,837
No, my friend.

1297
01:51:19,172 --> 01:51:20,715
Give me a hand.

1298
01:51:25,136 --> 01:51:26,721
My family won't forgive me for this.

1299
01:51:27,639 --> 01:51:30,100
Who will take Vika to school for the first time?

1300
01:51:32,686 --> 01:51:34,145
Listen, Comrade Belyaev,

1301
01:51:34,813 --> 01:51:36,398
nobody has ordered us to give up.

1302
01:51:36,773 --> 01:51:38,149
Don't get bored, I'll be back soon.

1303
01:52:15,687 --> 01:52:17,564
Send the following command:

1304
01:52:18,481 --> 01:52:20,817
Put everything into the air that flies.

1305
01:52:20,984 --> 01:52:24,320
Double the search area.
- Yes, sir.

1306
01:52:26,823 --> 01:52:28,158
General Kamanin's order...

1307
01:52:29,409 --> 01:52:32,579
Please send the text now
for the official message.

1308
01:52:32,746 --> 01:52:35,248
Which one, Nikolay Petrovich?

1309
01:52:35,415 --> 01:52:36,791
Both of them.

1310
01:52:40,670 --> 01:52:41,880
Good evening, comrades.

1311
01:53:07,363 --> 01:53:09,073
May I have some water?

1312
01:53:40,438 --> 01:53:41,481
I'm ready.

1313
01:53:52,826 --> 01:53:55,119
<i>On the 18th of March...

1314

1319
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:26,484

1322

01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,627

01:55:13,323 --> 01:55:16,284
<i>in the death of the crew.

1330
01:55:20,705 --> 01:55:22,665
Have you guys completely lost your minds?

1331
01:55:24,876 --> 01:55:28,838
Hey! Where are you?

1332
01:55:29,672 --> 01:55:31,716
Are you all stupid?

1333
01:55:32,634 --> 01:55:35,553
We are alive here! Hey!

1334
01:55:35,845 --> 01:55:37,847
We're alive here!

1335
01:55:39,307 --> 01:55:41,434
Are you deaf or what?

1336
01:55:43,186 --> 01:55:44,395
Hey! We're alive!

1337
01:55:44,979 --> 01:55:49,108
Hey! We're alive! We're alive!

1338

Pasha!

1349
01:57:17,739 --> 01:57:19,032
Pasha!

1350
01:57:23,619 --> 01:57:25,872
Pasha! Pasha!

1351
01:57:28,166 --> 01:57:30,585
Are you Ok? Don't fall asleep!

1352
01:57:30,877 --> 01:57:34,172
Hey, Pasha! Pasha! Don't fall asleep!

1353
01:57:34,547 --> 01:57:37,050
Don't fall asleep, Pasha!

1354
01:57:38,468 --> 01:57:39,510
That's enough, Lyosha.

1355
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:43,514
Pavel Ivanovich.

1356
01:57:43,765 --> 01:57:47,060
Alright.
Do you know what we're going to do now?

1357
01:57:47,226 --> 01:57:49,145
We will write you a speech
for the journalists.

1358
01:57:49,312 --> 01:57:52,190
Because you're always standing like a...
- You'll handle it yourself.

1359
01:57:52,356 --> 01:57:54,942
You're the hero now.
- Am I? Nah.

1360
01:57:55,109 --> 01:57:58,112
You were a hero when I still helping to farm cows.

1361
01:57:58,279 --> 01:57:59,989
You'd already been to war.

1362
01:58:00,156 --> 01:58:02,116
How many battles had you fought?

1363
01:58:02,283 --> 01:58:04,202
I was still dreaming about the sky.
- One.

1364
01:58:05,536 --> 01:58:07,121
One what?

1365
01:58:07,288 --> 01:58:09,248
One combat mission.

1366
01:58:09,415 --> 01:58:10,625
And...

1367
01:58:11,209 --> 01:58:14,045
I didn't even shoot.

1368
01:58:14,879 --> 01:58:17,590
The older guys fought,

1369
01:58:17,757 --> 01:58:20,968
and we younger guys, prepared
the planes and swept the runway.

1370
01:58:23,638 --> 01:58:26,307
And finally, when they gave me a flight...

1371
01:58:26,641 --> 01:58:29,519
I thought, now it's my turn!

1372
01:58:29,685 --> 01:58:32,063
Maybe I'll be useful for something.

1373
01:58:32,772 --> 01:58:35,441
The enemy didn't attack us.

1374
01:58:35,608 --> 01:58:38,444
We flew and returned...

1375
01:58:39,112 --> 01:58:41,239
back to the base.

1376
01:58:43,407 --> 01:58:47,537
And that was it.
On the next day they surrendered.

1377
01:58:48,287 --> 01:58:52,333
Well, here's your "hero" Pavel Belyaev.

1378
01:59:05,638 --> 01:59:09,600
Do you know why I went to flight school?

1379
01:59:09,767 --> 01:59:13,980
Why?
- The allowance was bigger than at the art Academy.

1380
01:59:14,147 --> 01:59:17,525
Right now I would be painting my pictures
and living carefree. But no!

1381
01:59:17,692 --> 01:59:21,737
Instead, the whole world has seen

1382
01:59:21,904 --> 01:59:25,032
how I dangled from a string in space.

1383
01:59:25,199 --> 01:59:30,371
Suit was inflated so much, I almost shit.
Here's the space conqueror Leonov!

1384
01:59:30,538 --> 01:59:33,332
Pashka, I'm sorry.

1385
01:59:34,333 --> 01:59:36,252
That I got you into this.

1386
01:59:36,419 --> 01:59:38,337
No...

1387
01:59:39,755 --> 01:59:41,424
It's good.

1388
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:44,343
What's good?

1389
01:59:44,510 --> 01:59:46,721
It's good that you

1390
01:59:47,430 --> 01:59:49,599
didn't become an artist.

1391
01:59:49,765 --> 01:59:52,185
Otherwise, who else...

1392
01:59:52,351 --> 01:59:55,271
would I fly with?

1393
01:59:58,566 --> 02:00:01,277
Maybe we will fly again.

1394
02:00:03,070 --> 02:00:06,991
We do as we are told, Lyosha.

1395
02:00:07,158 --> 02:00:10,786
We do what we are told.

1396
02:00:42,401 --> 02:00:43,986
They've landed.

1397
02:00:44,153 --> 02:00:45,696
Successfully.

1398
02:00:45,863 --> 02:00:47,615
And they need help.

1399
02:00:47,782 --> 02:00:51,889
But nobody's coming to them.
- But they will come for you,

1400
02:00:52,036 --> 02:00:54,121
and you'll go to jail.

1401
02:00:54,914 --> 02:00:57,333
And I won't have anyone to ask for help.

1402
02:01:12,390 --> 02:01:13,808
I have to do it.

1403
02:01:30,616 --> 02:01:33,619
NINE HOURS AFTER LANDING

1404
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:36,831
The weather has deteriorated.

1405
02:01:36,998 --> 02:01:39,208
I have to cancel the search.

1406
02:01:42,586 --> 02:01:44,338
I see.

1407
02:01:44,547 --> 02:01:47,800
As soon as the storm settles...
- Yes, yes of course.

1408
02:01:48,843 --> 02:01:52,138
We have to inform the families.

1409
02:01:53,306 --> 02:01:57,059
Sergey Pavlovich, maybe...
we shouldn't hurry?

1410
02:01:57,226 --> 02:01:59,395
But what do you want?

1411
02:01:59,562 --> 02:02:02,898
Do you want them to hear about it
from the radio announcer?

1412
02:02:04,275 --> 02:02:05,609
We have a signal!

1413
02:02:06,402 --> 02:02:08,946
Sergey Pavlovich, it seems...
we've got the signal.

1414
02:02:09,155 --> 02:02:11,490
What you mean, "it seems"?
- I'm sorry, comrade Lieutenant General.

1415
02:02:11,657 --> 02:02:13,784
There was a call from the committee.

1416
02:02:13,951 --> 02:02:16,162
Some radio hobbyist from Sakhalin
got in touch with them.

1417
02:02:16,329 --> 02:02:20,082
He says, he accidentally got a signal
from the cosmonauts.

1418
02:02:20,499 --> 02:02:22,418
Accidentally? How's that an accident?
- Accidentally?

1419
02:02:22,626 --> 02:02:26,130
A radio amateur? -Yes.
Sakhalin? -Yes.

1420
02:02:26,547 --> 02:02:29,133
Which section?
- According to the triangulation...

1421
02:02:29,342 --> 02:02:33,262
it turns out.. section 62.
- Do we have anyone at the 62nd?

1422
02:02:35,389 --> 02:02:37,683
Yes, we have one helicopter
within a mile from there.

1423
02:02:37,850 --> 02:02:39,602
Call him.
- Yes, sir.

1424
02:02:41,729 --> 02:02:45,649
"Craft 216! The signal from the cosmonauts
was located at the 62nd square"

1425
02:02:45,983 --> 02:02:49,195
You are the closest.
Try to gain visual contact.

1426
02:02:49,403 --> 02:02:53,199
"I repeat, try to gain visual contact"

1427
02:02:53,366 --> 02:02:55,117
This is 216.

1428
02:02:55,534 --> 02:02:58,412
I'm at section 62.

1429
02:02:58,621 --> 02:03:00,790
Very bad weather conditions.

1430
02:03:00,956 --> 02:03:04,168
Continue the search while you can.
- Yes, sir.

1431
02:03:15,262 --> 02:03:17,014
You hear it?

1432
02:03:22,478 --> 02:03:24,230
You hear it?

1433
02:03:26,607 --> 02:03:28,484
That's for us.

1434
02:03:29,193 --> 02:03:31,237
They've found us.

1435
02:03:34,573 --> 02:03:37,785
Where is... the flare gun?

1436
02:03:39,995 --> 02:03:41,539
Pasha.

1437
02:03:46,919 --> 02:03:48,879
Where's the flare gun?

1438
02:03:49,046 --> 02:03:50,131
Did I lose it?

1439
02:03:51,141 --> 02:03:53,050
Huh? I'm confused.

1440
02:03:56,345 --> 02:04:00,474
Commander, the tanks are almost dry.
We should get back, or we
might not make it to the base.

1441
02:04:02,101 --> 02:04:04,603
This is 216. Our tank is almost empty.

1442
02:04:05,980 --> 02:04:07,148
They have to get back.

1443
02:04:07,356 --> 02:04:09,859
Let them come back.
- Yes, sir.

1444
02:04:11,944 --> 02:04:14,905
216, return to base.

1445
02:04:18,617 --> 02:04:20,077
216,

1446
02:04:20,786 --> 02:04:23,205
This is Sergey Korolev.

1447
02:04:23,372 --> 02:04:24,999
What's your name?

1448
02:04:25,166 --> 02:04:26,417
"Major Markelov"

1449
02:04:27,334 --> 02:04:28,502
"And your first name?"

1450
02:04:28,669 --> 02:04:30,254
Vladimir.

1451
02:04:30,963 --> 02:04:33,382
"Volodya, listen to me"

1452
02:04:33,841 --> 02:04:35,593
Somewhere in the forest,

1453
02:04:35,759 --> 02:04:37,219
between the trees,

1454
02:04:37,386 --> 02:04:38,762
hangs a parachute.

1455
02:04:38,929 --> 02:04:41,849
It's very big and noticeable.

1456
02:04:42,933 --> 02:04:45,853
Please, look closely.

1457
02:04:46,520 --> 02:04:48,439
It's hard not to notice it.

1458
02:04:49,273 --> 02:04:50,900
"Do you hear me?"

1459
02:04:51,066 --> 02:04:51,984
Yes.

1460
02:05:00,451 --> 02:05:04,538
What the... Where did I put it?

1461
02:05:04,747 --> 02:05:07,708
What are you doing?

1462
02:05:07,917 --> 02:05:09,376
Come on, help!

1463
02:05:10,211 --> 02:05:12,963
Lyosha, help, it froze.

1464
02:05:15,341 --> 02:05:17,635
Pashka!

1465
02:05:19,553 --> 02:05:23,307
Here you go. Hold on.

1466
02:05:24,058 --> 02:05:26,143
We are on emergency reserve.
We have to turn back.

1467
02:05:30,606 --> 02:05:33,609
Lyosha, send us a signal.
We can not see anything.

1468
02:05:33,943 --> 02:05:35,945
Hold on, Pasha.

1469
02:05:36,445 --> 02:05:38,322
You're the hero.

1470
02:05:38,781 --> 02:05:41,325
Wait... I'll help you.

1471
02:05:48,624 --> 02:05:49,667
Commander,

1472
02:05:49,917 --> 02:05:53,045
we have to turn back,
or we won't make it.

1473
02:05:53,212 --> 02:05:55,172
"This is 216"

1474
02:05:55,839 --> 02:05:58,008
"I have not seen a parachute"

1475
02:05:58,217 --> 02:06:00,094
"There's no signal from the cosmonauts"

1476
02:06:01,220 --> 02:06:03,889
We tried.
We are sorry.

1477
02:06:06,767 --> 02:06:09,812
I can't bend my fingers.
- Come on, do it slowly.

1478
02:06:09,979 --> 02:06:12,022
Pasha, do it slowly.

1479
02:06:17,236 --> 02:06:19,113
Come on, Pasha.

1480
02:06:19,280 --> 02:06:21,657
Come on!
- I can't.

1481
02:06:25,119 --> 02:06:26,203
216,

1482
02:06:26,370 --> 02:06:27,830
"return to base"

1483
02:06:28,205 --> 02:06:29,623
Copy. Going back.

1484
02:06:36,463 --> 02:06:39,633
This is 216. I see a flare!

1485
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:41,218
"A signal flare!"

1486
02:06:41,385 --> 02:06:43,387
Call the rescue unit!

1487
02:06:43,554 --> 02:06:45,472
"We're copying the exact coordinates!"

1488
02:06:45,639 --> 02:06:50,019
"20 miles south-east of Bereznyaky..."

1489
02:07:33,103 --> 02:07:36,398
Thank you, Volodya.

1490
02:07:51,664 --> 02:07:55,584
Now I want to drink something.
A vodka, if you can.

1491
02:07:55,834 --> 02:07:57,753
Sure, Sergey Pavlovich.

1492
02:08:09,098 --> 02:08:12,518
MILITARY AIRPORT TSCHKALOVSKY,
OBLAST MOSCOW

1493
02:08:12,685 --> 02:08:14,728
THREE DAYS AFTER THE LAUNCH

1494
02:09:06,447 --> 02:09:07,406
Papa!

1495
02:09:16,206 --> 02:09:17,875
Lyoshka!

1496
02:09:18,751 --> 02:09:20,085
Papa!

1497
02:09:21,962 --> 02:09:23,338
Lyoshka!

1498
02:09:31,263 --> 02:09:34,016
What are you doing, kid?
Where did you go in the middle of the night?

1499
02:09:37,144 --> 02:09:39,772
She sleeps in the nest.
- Who?

1500
02:09:39,938 --> 02:09:41,565
The bird.

1501
02:09:42,149 --> 02:09:44,443
Good for you!

1502
02:09:44,985 --> 02:09:47,780
Were you scared?

1503
02:09:53,786 --> 02:09:56,580
Your heart is beating so fast.

1504
02:09:56,747 --> 02:10:00,292
Were you running around?
- No, papa. I did not run,

1505
02:10:00,459 --> 02:10:02,419
I flew.

1506
