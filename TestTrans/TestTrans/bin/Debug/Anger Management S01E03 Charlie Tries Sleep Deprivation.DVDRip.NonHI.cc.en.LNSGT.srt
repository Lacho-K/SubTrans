1
00:00:02,986 --> 00:00:04,031
Just going to drop
her on the couch.

2
00:00:04,055 --> 00:00:07,006
Okay. I'll pick her up tomorrow.

3
00:00:07,074 --> 00:00:09,069
You're not driving home until
you have another cup of coffee.

4
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:12,694
Hey, don't worry about whispering.
She slept through everything.

5
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:16,331
Jet engines, turbulence,
bipolar flight attendants.

6
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:18,934
I hate her so much. I hate you!

7
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,470
No, I don't. I love you.

8
00:00:24,507 --> 00:00:25,974
I resent her youth.

9
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:29,728
Coffee may not be the answer.

10
00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:31,630
How long has it been
since you've slept?

11
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:35,500
Ah, Let's see, uh, I didn't
get any sleep at your parents',

12
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,468
both our flights were delayed,

13
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:40,150
somebody phoned in a bomb
threat to the Taco Bell Express,

14
00:00:40,174 --> 00:00:42,573
they shut down the airport so...

15
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,842
Four hundred eighty-seven hours?

16
00:00:46,897 --> 00:00:48,797
You need to lie down. Come on.

17
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:50,231
Okay.

18
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,435
Go away, balls.

19
00:00:53,904 --> 00:00:55,571
No, no, no.

20
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,384
We don't sleep on pool tables
anymore. We're parents now.

21
00:00:58,408 --> 00:00:59,875
Nothing fun or weird.

22
00:00:59,944 --> 00:01:01,092
Your mother's a bitch.

23
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:03,512
Woah, woah!

24
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,014
Woah, where'd that come
from? I thought you liked her.

25
00:01:06,082 --> 00:01:09,934
Never did. Your dad, on
the other hand, he's a flirt.

26
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:13,505
Has he ever flirted with you?

27
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:16,934
No, he only flirts with
people he likes. Come on.

28
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:22,947
Oh, my God. Oh, this is heaven.

29
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,584
What are you doing in heaven?

30
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:30,222
Part of an exchange program. Gandhi's
down there at a strip club with Mussolini.

31
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,024
Just sleep.

32
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,794
Mmm. Okay.

33
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:39,275
Hey, remember that time when I tried
to trick you into getting me pregnant

34
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,419
to save our marriage?

35
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,466
What? No!

36
00:01:43,586 --> 00:01:48,673
Yeah. Sam was eight and I stopped
taking the pill and started sleeping naked.

37
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:50,275
You don't remember?

38
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:53,395
I remember the naked thing. I
didn't think you wanted a baby.

39
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:55,430
I thought you wanted a new car.

40
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:57,949
Mmm.

41
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:02,954
But it's all right. We have the
greatest kid ever and you're a good dad.

42
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:04,873
Good night.

43
00:02:04,942 --> 00:02:07,442
Wait, wait. Before
you fall asleep,

44
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,889
the time we went to Vegas and
you told me that you got robbed.

45
00:02:09,913 --> 00:02:11,063
Did that really happen?

46
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,416
No, I lost it all on
blackjack. Remember?

47
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:18,536
This is like a truth serum.

48
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:21,556
Is it hard for you to find another
guy because I set the bar too high?

49
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:22,941
No.

50
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,876
What do you know?
You're half asleep.

51
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:29,605
Nolan?

52
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,294
Nolan!

53
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:33,301
What?

54
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,548
What do you think about the fact
that Ed just called you a pussy?

55
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,638
I didn't hear that.

56
00:02:36,707 --> 00:02:38,440
Ed? Pussy.

57
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:41,577
He's probably right.

58
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,400
Now, hold on. Before
everybody leaves,

59
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:52,888
I want to invite you all to take part in
something that I am very excited about.

60
00:02:52,956 --> 00:02:58,376
Oh, I knew this day was coming.
It's either real estate or vitamins.

61
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:02,914
No, Ed. A few nights ago, I had
an experience that led me to believe

62
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:06,112
that we could advance the
frontiers of psychological study.

63
00:03:06,136 --> 00:03:08,581
I'm talking about stripping
away your defenses to a point

64
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,122
where inhibitions come
down and truths come out.

65
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,424
So, what? We're all
going to get drunk?

66
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,862
No. I'm talking about
sleep deprivation therapy.

67
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,381
Can I be drunk for that?

68
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,281
No. Because sometimes
when people get drunk,

69
00:03:24,305 --> 00:03:27,700
they grab a gun and shoot
their boyfriends in the testicles.

70
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:29,519
You're talking about
me, aren't you?

71
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,824
I thought that was
abundantly clear.

72
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:34,774
Now, I've done a lot
of research on this.

73
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,810
I think if we stay up long enough, we
can get to a whole new level of honesty.

74
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:41,169
That's the way my old
associate in Nam used to do it.

75
00:03:41,237 --> 00:03:44,339
You ought to bring
Pho Than Kwon in here.

76
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:48,760
That old boy kept me awake 70
hours straight at the Hanoi Hilton,

77
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,812
getting intel out of me.

78
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:55,099
Seriously, you can get him. He's got a
noodle shop down at the Music Center.

79
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,571
He gives me 10% off
because he tortured me.

80
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,205
A real sweetheart.

81
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,610
It's your mistake for
staying at a Hilton.

82
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:11,082
I want you all here on Friday
for a weekend workshop.

83
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,769
Some of us might have
plans this weekend.

84
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,321
And what were
you planning to do?

85
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:20,609
Call my friends and ask them why they
never invite me anywhere on the weekends.

86
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,429
I guess I could reschedule
it for next weekend.

87
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,914
How are we going
to stay up that long?

88
00:04:26,984 --> 00:04:31,353
The way Pho Than kept us awake, he'd
take a car battery and some jumper cables

89
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:33,972
and clamp them onto our nipples.

90
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,919
I think we'll start with coffee.

91
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:39,377
Pho Than used coffee, too. He'd boil up
a big pot and then make us bend over...

92
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,696
We're just going to drink it.

93
00:04:40,764 --> 00:04:41,929
We drank it.

94
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:52,724
Anyway, so they make me empty my
pockets with all my good-luck charms

95
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,209
in front of everybody,
including Jake Slater.

96
00:04:55,278 --> 00:04:57,829
It's midterms. I had
all my good luck stuff.

97
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,509
My silver dollar,
my dreamcatcher,

98
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:01,216
my <i>Monopoly</i> dog...

99
00:05:01,284 --> 00:05:03,713
Hey, at least you didn't have the
pouch full of your baby teeth. Right?

100
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:06,421
Oh, crap. You
had the baby teeth.

101
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,956
Well, I had to. I
had an algebra test.

102
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:11,943
I'm a freak.

103
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:15,612
No, you're not. I know tons of people
who carry good-luck charms. Here.

104
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:20,697
My dad made this penny for me
when we went to Carlsbad Caverns.

105
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:23,132
It was the best day we ever had.

106
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,617
Do you always
carry this with you?

107
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:27,776
Yeah. So I guess
I'm a freak, too.

108
00:05:27,845 --> 00:05:29,322
And if Jake Slater
doesn't like you,

109
00:05:29,346 --> 00:05:31,746
because you carry a pouch
full of baby teeth, then...

110
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:34,189
Well, you understand why, right?

111
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:39,298
It's open.

112
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,539
Hey, Charlie. Hey, Sam.

113
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:44,587
Hi. Hey, Kate. I'm
going to go pack.

114
00:05:47,163 --> 00:05:50,549
Why doesn't she like me? Do you
think she knows we're sleeping together?

115
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:53,601
Nobody knows. Maybe
she's just intimidated by you.

116
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:58,673
That's cool. So, why am I here?

117
00:05:58,741 --> 00:06:01,776
Because I want to ask you to help
me with my sleep deprivation project.

118
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:04,390
I need another psychologist there
to supervise the group for a few hours

119
00:06:04,414 --> 00:06:06,126
while I rest so I can
be fresh for the session.

120
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,561
Well, I would, but you're not still
going through with that, are you?

121
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:10,980
Kate, Kate. This is
breakthrough research

122
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,782
and really positive
for my patients.

123
00:06:12,806 --> 00:06:14,238
Breakthrough research?

124
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,719
Somebody wants to get into
the <i>Journal of Applied Psychology.</i>

125
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,677
But my primary
concern is my patients.

126
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,524
Come on, Charlie. You're
desperate for recognition.

127
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,544
You can't play baseball anymore, so
you're trying to get it in psychotherapy.

128
00:06:24,568 --> 00:06:27,346
So? What's wrong with wanting to be
known as the best in your profession?

129
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,238
Because you're experimenting on
human beings and sleep deprivation

130
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:33,408
is not a recognized therapeutic
tool. God, you can be so stubborn.

131
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:37,478
I am not being stubborn. I'm laying
the foundation for a new methodology.

132
00:06:37,547 --> 00:06:39,787
And, for the record,
you're a therapeutic tool.

133
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,767
Drat. Outwitted.

134
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,707
Hey, Charlie. Hey,
Kate. Sam ready to go?

135
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:52,096
She's upstairs grabbing her bag, and
thanks again for taking her on my weekend.

136
00:06:52,128 --> 00:06:54,261
Oh, well, it's probably a
good idea she's not here

137
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,064
for your crazy people
stay-up-all-night party.

138
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:59,200
I mean, I'm not a professional,

139
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:02,854
but seems to me that unstable
people need as much sleep as possible.

140
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,606
Right. Get some rest.

141
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:15,216
You know, there's something I've
been wanting to say to you for a long time.

142
00:07:15,284 --> 00:07:16,517
Yeah?

143
00:07:16,586 --> 00:07:19,620
It's really stupid, but
for the longest time

144
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,524
I thought you and Charlie
had the hots for each other.

145
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:24,042
You're kidding.

146
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:26,477
I know. It's crazy. I
mean, you're gay, right?

147
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:36,037
I mean, I'm not "gay" gay. I
mean, I like to live in the moment.

148
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:39,958
You're so cool. We
should hang out.

149
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:48,683
Patrick, you're early.

150
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:51,419
Didn't realize traffic
was going to be so light,

151
00:07:51,488 --> 00:07:53,299
but since I'm the
first person here

152
00:07:53,323 --> 00:07:58,492
for our "no sleepover,"
I'll just take the couch.

153
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,721
Patrick, if you want the couch, just
say you got here early to take the couch.

154
00:08:01,765 --> 00:08:04,477
Nobody is going to be petty enough
to compete with you for the couch.

155
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:07,536
Damn it! I wanted the couch.

156
00:08:10,207 --> 00:08:13,307
Oh, crap! The couch is gone.

157
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:16,022
I told you if I let you pick
me up, you had to be on time.

158
00:08:16,046 --> 00:08:18,124
I'm sorry. I've never
been to your house before.

159
00:08:18,148 --> 00:08:21,268
Please. I've seen you parked
outside my house for hours.

160
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:23,218
Well, not in daytime.

161
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:29,986
Okay, guys. As you can see,
I've set up a few cameras around

162
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,187
to document the workshop.
Woah, woah, woah, woah.

163
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,462
Whoa. I did not
agree to be filmed.

164
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,476
Okay, then I will make sure that no
footage of you winds up in my presentation.

165
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:43,371
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I did not agree not to be filmed.

166
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,652
Okay. We've all been up for about 12
hours, but most sleep deprivation symptoms

167
00:08:46,676 --> 00:08:50,411
don't kick in until after 36. So we'll
start the session tomorrow night.

168
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,314
Until then, the only
rule is to stay awake.

169
00:08:55,152 --> 00:08:56,684
Ed, wake up.

170
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,471
Ed? Ed!

171
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,239
Oh, my God. He's not breathing.

172
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:06,744
You hit your feet,
you lose your seat.

173
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,628
I think I can trace a lot of
my anger back to the moment

174
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,052
I found out my mother died.

175
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:18,956
I was in the back of
a cab with my brother.

176
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:24,111
He hung up the phone, he turned
to me and he said, "Mom's dead."

177
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,917
There was nothing in his eyes.

178
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:32,187
It was like he didn't even care.

179
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:35,523
I said, "What's the matter
with you? Our mother is dead!"

180
00:09:35,592 --> 00:09:36,903
You know what?
That sucked. Okay.

181
00:09:39,762 --> 00:09:44,348
Patrick, we're 24 hours in. You've been
in front of the camera for half of that.

182
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,719
So far your mother has died in a
cab, on a train, in a plane, in a boat.

183
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:51,255
The only place she hasn't
died is in a box with a fox.

184
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,991
Stop rehearsing
your breakthrough.

185
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:56,427
Ed, what was that?

186
00:09:56,496 --> 00:09:59,030
I was playing the
video bowling game

187
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,465
and the controller
slipped out of my hand.

188
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,285
I think I'm losing
my muscle control.

189
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,172
That's great! That's the
third sign of sleep deprivation.

190
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,333
What's the first one?

191
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,741
Unsubstantiated euphoria. Yes!

192
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:15,012
Kate should be here any
minute to cover for me.

193
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,918
I'm cold. Nolan,
give me your blanket.

194
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,170
Sure. Here you go.

195
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:29,260
Hey, Patrick? What do you
think about me and Lacey?

196
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,595
Yeah, not a big fan.

197
00:10:32,249 --> 00:10:34,226
I mean, could you
see us together?

198
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,412
The only way that happens
is if she's robbing a gas station

199
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:38,603
and using you as a human shield.

200
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:41,756
But you do see
us together. Cool.

201
00:10:45,462 --> 00:10:46,961
Thank God you're here.

202
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,830
I'm leaving.

203
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,843
What do you mean you're leaving? I
have to get some sleep before the session.

204
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:53,962
I have a client who's having a
breakdown. She's at the hospital.

205
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,820
Okay. This may
sound a little harsh,

206
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:57,667
but can't they just strap her to
a gurney, pump her full of drugs,

207
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:00,441
and let her ride it out? You
know, kicking it old-school?

208
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,210
I have to sign her in.

209
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:03,690
So you'll be gone,
what, a couple of hours?

210
00:11:03,714 --> 00:11:05,780
The family is committing her.

211
00:11:05,849 --> 00:11:07,927
The paperwork takes forever. That's
why we never did it with my mom.

212
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:11,202
It was easier to just let her run
around the house naked, covered in jam.

213
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:15,373
Okay. I really can't
process that right now.

214
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:17,375
But if you're not back in time,

215
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:20,311
I'll have to do the session
on 36 hours of no sleep.

216
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:25,015
I'm sorry, but your muscle coordination
seems fine, your pupils are responsive,

217
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:28,085
and you're showing no signs
of unsubstantiated euphoria.

218
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,566
Look, let me just go and I
will get back as fast as I can.

219
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,857
You will? You will? Yeah!

220
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,819
Hey.

221
00:11:44,888 --> 00:11:46,020
Yeah?

222
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:49,841
So it's been almost 36
hours. How you doing?

223
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,645
Not good. I think I just texted a
picture of my boobs to my dentist.

224
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,965
Oh.

225
00:11:58,034 --> 00:12:01,354
What a coincidence. He wants me
to come in tomorrow for a cleaning.

226
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,689
So, anyway, uh...

227
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,724
I was thinking, if you're
not doing anything,

228
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,593
I hear there's
pizza in the kitchen.

229
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:12,079
Do you want to go? Or I
could just bring you a piece.

230
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,827
I don't want you touching
my food. I'll get it myself.

231
00:12:14,851 --> 00:12:16,985
Great. It's a date.

232
00:12:20,356 --> 00:12:25,693
We got a great table. Only
problem is it's so close to the kitchen.

233
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:33,267
Give me a Coke.

234
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,469
Okay.

235
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,267
This will be fine.

236
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,586
That was funny.

237
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:57,542
Thanks. When I'm
tired, I'm really funny.

238
00:13:00,163 --> 00:13:01,229
Fork.

239
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:08,686
Hey, guys. I'm going to make
some more coffee. What's so funny?

240
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:11,623
This fork was being hilarious.

241
00:13:13,142 --> 00:13:15,142
All right. Giddy and
mildly delusional.

242
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,795
I think we're getting
real close to a session.

243
00:13:17,864 --> 00:13:20,565
Really? Already?

244
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:24,569
I must have completely lost
track of time. This was great.

245
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:29,257
I hope we can do this again. I'm
going to go splash some pee on my face.

246
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:36,080
Face on my pee.
I will see you later.

247
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,498
And I meant water.

248
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,093
It's a crazy night, huh?

249
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,327
You holding up okay?

250
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:54,365
Oh, yeah. Mmm-hmm. You've
got something right there.

251
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:56,634
Did I get it?

252
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:58,736
Uh, no. Here, let me.

253
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:02,941
Lacey, you can't do that!

254
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,893
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm
sorry. I meant to do this.

255
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:11,665
That's the same
thing! Lacey. Lacey.

256
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:13,612
You have to stop
this. You're exhausted.

257
00:14:13,636 --> 00:14:15,564
What's going on right
now is called transference.

258
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:18,523
I'm going to get a tattoo
of you somewhere special,

259
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:21,909
and if you grow a little
beard, it will look perfect.

260
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:28,177
You're having these emotions because
you feel like I'm the only man in your life

261
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,002
who listens to you and
cares about you right now.

262
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:37,124
Oh, my God. You're right. What
am I doing? This is so embarrassing.

263
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:42,296
It's okay. Sorry. Nobody
will know. You're tired.

264
00:14:42,365 --> 00:14:43,842
You don't know
what you're doing.

265
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:45,032
Yes, I do.

266
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:47,835
Okay, you do a little bit.

267
00:14:50,206 --> 00:14:52,918
You've clearly lost all your
inhibitions. It's time to get started.

268
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:54,158
Great.

269
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,326
With the session.

270
00:14:58,848 --> 00:15:02,216
Okay, everyone. Time for
the session. Let's do this.

271
00:15:02,285 --> 00:15:04,218
Ed, please turn off
the bowling game.

272
00:15:04,287 --> 00:15:05,652
All right. Fine.

273
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:16,930
Okay. I think we're at a point
now where we have the opportunity

274
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,018
to get beneath the surface of some
issues we've all been wrestling with.

275
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:25,106
Please, Ed. Tell me
you're still bowling.

276
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,311
Who would like
to start? I would.

277
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:33,692
Two years ago, I was in New York. I
was in the back of the cab and my brother

278
00:15:33,716 --> 00:15:34,748
got a phone call.

279
00:15:34,818 --> 00:15:37,602
Does anybody
have something real?

280
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,338
I would like to talk
about something real.

281
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:42,184
Okay, but remember, even
though we're in therapy,

282
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:45,459
there are some things that
nobody wants to hear about.

283
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:50,147
Oh, you'll want to hear this. I've had
a lot of boyfriends break up with me

284
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:52,533
because they say I'm too sexual.

285
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:57,671
Well, stuff happens.
Nolan, you've been quiet.

286
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,941
Actually, I really want to
hear what Lacey has to say.

287
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,893
Me, too. Sing it.

288
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,601
When I want someone,
I just have to have them.

289
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,870
And I tell them
nothing's off-limits.

290
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:17,774
You can't hurt me. Is
that unusual, Charlie?

291
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:20,994
Is there something
wrong with me?

292
00:16:22,999 --> 00:16:27,268
You seeing what I'm seeing?
That is an unusual way to sit, right?

293
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,558
Okay. Lacey,
let's get into this.

294
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:37,206
Your sexually provocative
behavior is probably just you

295
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,574
trying to fill an emotional void
left behind from your childhood.

296
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:44,535
Wow. Void. Someone likes to
talk dirty with people watching.

297
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,706
She's a complete slut.

298
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:51,215
I could have told you
that from the shoes.

299
00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:56,830
I'm going to go get some
pizza. You remember pizza?

300
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:05,206
Looks like your ship is
taking on water, captain.

301
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:08,542
Not helping, Ed. People are just
getting into some more difficult truths.

302
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,690
Lacey is this close to realizing that
she doesn't need to use sex to get love.

303
00:17:11,714 --> 00:17:13,681
I use love to get sex.

304
00:17:13,749 --> 00:17:16,750
Love is empty and meaningless,
and sex lasts forever.

305
00:17:19,822 --> 00:17:22,656
Two down, two to go.
Time to call in a Mayday.

306
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:23,841
Ed, please.

307
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,721
Everyone is experiencing
emotions but me.

308
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,456
Why can't I feel anything real?

309
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,965
This isn't even real.

310
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:35,069
You just hit the iceberg, boy.
This whole thing is going down.

311
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:37,004
If I were you, I
would call it a day.

312
00:17:37,073 --> 00:17:38,217
I know what I'm doing.

313
00:17:38,241 --> 00:17:41,041
The hell you do. Shut up, Dad!

314
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,813
I apologize for "shut up."

315
00:17:46,882 --> 00:17:50,442
I'm going to need a few minutes
in the kitchen to figure out "Dad."

316
00:17:56,793 --> 00:17:59,527
You okay?

317
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:02,107
I tried to be objective and I
wind up yelling at a patient.

318
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:07,067
Oh, come on, Charlie. Wake
up. Look what happened here.

319
00:18:07,136 --> 00:18:12,173
You called one of your patients Dad. Freud
would be creaming his jeans over that.

320
00:18:12,241 --> 00:18:14,225
Freud wouldn't wear
jeans. He wore a slip.

321
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:18,229
A Freudian slip. I'm so tired.

322
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,199
But your hypothesis was correct.

323
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:25,302
The inhibitions came
down and the truth came out.

324
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:26,570
Yeah, for me.

325
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:28,399
Nobody else had a breakthrough?

326
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,337
Lacey cried, Nolan yelled, and Patrick
realized he's avoiding his real emotions.

327
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:34,862
That is huge! And what did
you realize about your dad?

328
00:18:36,131 --> 00:18:38,131
I don't know.
What did I realize?

329
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,467
Wake up!

330
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:43,348
Ed, he's on my ass just like
my dad's been my whole life.

331
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,850
I've never been
good enough for him.

332
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,274
And?

333
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:47,342
And?

334
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:48,676
Wake up!

335
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:54,648
Now it's just about
hitting me, isn't it?

336
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:58,419
Why did you do this study? Who
do you want recognition from?

337
00:18:58,487 --> 00:19:00,465
Have you asked yourself
even one of these questions?

338
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:02,851
Well, not yet. Someone has
been slapping the crap out of me.

339
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,698
Okay. I'm still trying
to make my dad proud.

340
00:19:05,722 --> 00:19:08,245
That's what this
whole thing was about.

341
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:13,049
Why can't I be a normal person and
just want to have sex with my mom?

342
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:21,074
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.

343
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:23,127
Except it's eggables
and tofacon.

344
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:30,545
Ed, I'm very sorry about
last night. I was really burnt.

345
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,037
Good, because I was afraid
you were going to come over here

346
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:35,139
and ask me to take
you fishing or something.

347
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:39,310
If you want to go to a
strip club, I'd be up for that.

348
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,079
No, no.

349
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,114
Here's your blanket.

350
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,985
Keep it. Someday when you're lying
in your bed with it wrapped around you,

351
00:19:48,054 --> 00:19:50,137
I want you to think about
what could have been.

352
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:53,074
Just take your stupid blanket.

353
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,198
You okay?

354
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:04,446
Yeah. Whatever I did last night,
don't take it seriously. I was crazy.

355
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,720
We all got a little
crazy last night.

356
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:10,174
I was thinking
about what you said,

357
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:13,694
and I may have some anger
stuff from when I was a kid,

358
00:20:13,763 --> 00:20:16,113
stuff from my dad
leaving or whatever.

359
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:19,517
Welcome to the
club. This is a penny

360
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:22,520
my dad made for me
at Carlsbad Caverns.

361
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:26,573
It's actually the last great time I
remember us ever having together.

362
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,808
I keep it for good luck.

363
00:20:29,945 --> 00:20:33,714
So it reminds you that, even though
you have issues with your parents,

364
00:20:33,783 --> 00:20:35,115
you can move past them?

365
00:20:35,184 --> 00:20:36,200
Exactly.

366
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:38,936
Thanks. Hope it works.

367
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:46,443
Isn't that the coin you have
been carrying around for 35 years?

368
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,562
Yeah.

369
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,815
Did you mean to give it to her?

370
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:53,385
No.

371
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:59,639
How are you feeling?

372
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:00,858
Sad.

373
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:07,965
Do you want me to take
you to Carlsbad Caverns?

374
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:11,229
Is that a euphemism
for something else?

375
00:21:11,253 --> 00:21:12,870
Yes.

376
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,171
Then, yes.
