

8
00:01:25,937 --> 00:01:29,305
They then looked like a womanizer.

9
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:30,932
They did not like.

10
00:01:31,821 --> 00:01:34,981
The week I left, things got worse.

11
00:01:36,038 --> 00:01:39,189
My parents insulted me, something for nothing normal about them.

12
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:43,364
And it all ended one afternoon, very bad.

13
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,812
You leave me at age 19 and not me ...

14
00:01:46,847 --> 00:01:49,512
I talk to my parents for 15 years.

15
00:01:51,057 --> 00:01:53,267
Whatever ... That's the story.

16
00:01:54,312 --> 00:01:57,610
Recently my parents looked for me on the Internet.

17
00:01:58,277 --> 00:02:00,197
They demanded to know their grandchildren.

18
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:01,365
Spend a week with them.

19
00:02:01,906 --> 00:02:05,162
I researched my parents and have a help page.

20
00:02:06,414 --> 00:02:07,803
People love them.

21
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:10,301
Ironically, advise people, that's what I heard.

22
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:15,186
Whatever, I told the boys and said they wanted to see them.

23
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,593
I told them I did not want them to be ...

24
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:18,188
and said they would go anyway.

25
00:02:18,716 --> 00:02:20,156
Are brats what can I say?

26
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:26,201
And my 15 year old daughter, wants to make a documentary about this.

27
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:28,114
Wait, wait, go back, huh ...

28
00:02:28,138 --> 00:02:30,148
Describes the events of the day you left ...

29
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:32,159
Farm your parents, at age 19.

30
00:02:34,576 --> 00:02:36,700
I did not choose to tell you something.

31
00:02:36,744 --> 00:02:41,345
If they want to tell, they are entitled okay?

32
00:02:41,418 --> 00:02:43,189
I want to do this for you.

33
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:45,678
Hey, they're good people.

34
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,510
Just ask them.

35
00:02:49,221 --> 00:02:51,741
What has already finished my part? I have yet to help them pack.

36
00:02:58,274 --> 00:03:01,842
I am chatting with two girls separately.

37
00:03:02,271 --> 00:03:04,018
Clarifies that the word "separate".

38
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:05,961
Not going to be that we believe are twins.

39
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,728
Explain that you are chatting.

40
00:03:07,784 --> 00:03:10,873
- Communicating, nothing more. - No, they are on the waiting list.

41
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,544
You're 13, how they are waiting lists?

42
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,637
I saw him in the shower, he does have to wait.

43
00:03:15,661 --> 00:03:17,153
And you do not have boobs!

44
00:03:17,177 --> 00:03:18,568
Stop and the two!

45
00:03:19,593 --> 00:03:21,518
And I need to chat.

46
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,439
It's a week, your phone will not work there.

47
00:03:24,463 --> 00:03:25,654
You will return home on Saturday.

48
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:27,362
Are you holding the camera right?

49
00:03:27,604 --> 00:03:29,506
- On one side girl okay? - According.

50
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:18,710
Our mother, Loretta Jamison ...

51
00:04:18,734 --> 00:04:21,561
She is dating an eligible, attractive and disheveled man.

52
00:04:21,585 --> 00:04:23,625
Called Miguel Diego Torres.

53
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:25,145
He loves her.

54
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,816
We decided to give a boost to this union, to give them time.

55
00:04:28,939 --> 00:04:30,264
They are going away.

56
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,958
A cruise on the Royal Caribbean.

57
00:04:33,193 --> 00:04:35,063
The typical beach cruiser.

58
00:04:35,278 --> 00:04:37,077
We visit our grandparents,

59
00:04:37,112 --> 00:04:38,419
to which we have ever seen.

60
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:41,658
We do not know what their character or their tastes.

61
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:42,682
Si.

62
00:04:42,873 --> 00:04:44,855
And we do not even know how they are.

63
00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:48,434
They could ... you to like crafts.

64
00:04:49,549 --> 00:04:51,549
You might think that boy bands are cute.

65
00:04:52,823 --> 00:04:53,823
¿Tickets?

66
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:55,654

67
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:57,417
Our grandparents receive us.

68
00:04:57,769 --> 00:04:59,644
Are You a prodigy of the cinema?

69
00:05:00,062 --> 00:05:02,431
Do you know? I used to be a good actor.

70
00:05:02,455 --> 00:05:03,989
Oh no, my camera is blinking.

71
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:07,050
Here I am, slandered, accused and perplexed.

72
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:08,134
Pierced my soul ...

73
00:05:08,217 --> 00:05:09,497
the launch of infamy.

74
00:05:09,532 --> 00:05:11,950
Unfortunately, I'll have to turn off the camera.

75
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:23,089
Since my father left us, my brother ...

76
00:05:23,113 --> 00:05:25,009
It is always worrying with germs.

77
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,792
The psychologist who saw him for months,

78
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,057

121
00:08:02,603 --> 00:08:05,403

Why do you wear the pants down so?

132
00:08:53,172 --> 00:08:54,172
Rapping.

133
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:56,302
It is a form of modern poetry.

134
00:08:56,926 --> 00:08:58,325

I ask the big bed.

159
00:10:11,864 --> 00:10:12,864

174
00:10:45,783 --> 00:10:47,329
Solo, still unpacking.

175
00:10:47,353 --> 00:10:48,490
Do not! Do not look at the camera.

176
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:50,789
That's.

177
00:10:53,628 --> 00:10:54,868
This is so nice.

178
00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:57,010
Stop looking at the camera!

179
00:10:57,034 --> 00:10:58,598
Unpack, as you would normally.

180
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:02,735
If I were not here, okay? I know, I know natural.

181
00:11:05,474 --> 00:11:06,690
So naturally?

182
00:11:07,893 --> 00:11:09,223
What an idiot you are!

183
00:11:14,613 --> 00:11:18,034
These are the people in the life of the grandparents.

184
00:11:21,246 --> 00:11:22,858
We must toast them a bit.

185
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:27,021
Not much, just a hint.

186
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,592
And where are they now?

187
00:11:40,817 --> 00:11:42,330
Out in the henhouse.

188
00:11:42,945 --> 00:11:44,819
How are you? Do not answer that, I do not care.

189
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:46,855
They will treat you well?

190
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,770
Have not you said something bad about me? No answer me!

191
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,640
This is like a divorce agreement.

192
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,977
We are one week every 15 years, and we have to be civilized.

193
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:57,584
Mom? We have already talked about this.

194
00:11:58,005 --> 00:11:59,169
We made a decision.

195
00:11:59,506 --> 00:12:01,285
You go, we're having great.

196
00:12:01,802 --> 00:12:04,049
Yes, you should go. According?

197
00:12:04,084 --> 00:12:05,724
So you will not be so grumpy when you return.

198
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,419
Here Jacques Cousteau wants ...

199
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,960
we go to buy swimsuits.

200
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,235
We set sail from the port in a few hours.

201
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:16,629
- Hi miguel. - Good Morning.

202
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,271
I do not believe it's going to do it!

203
00:12:21,036 --> 00:12:23,066
The employee of a Wal-Mart,

204
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,584
you are traveling in the world's largest cruise ship.

205
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,061
I hate spoiled brats.

206
00:12:30,008 --> 00:12:31,500
We will hate you!

207
00:12:33,387 --> 00:12:34,971
We are looking for visual attention.

208
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:36,997
Things that enrich decision.

209
00:12:37,015 --> 00:12:40,113
Things we do imagine, that lies beyond the frame.

210
00:12:41,062 --> 00:12:44,050
Record only what happens to you, as a party involved.

211
00:12:44,692 --> 00:12:46,831
And we discuss the staging morning.

212
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,971
So now, I'm like now co-director.

213
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:51,769
Secondary camera operator, is your official title.

214
00:12:53,957 --> 00:12:55,811
This is the first camera, mom ...

215
00:12:55,846 --> 00:12:58,191
found in the damaged container useful things.

216
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:04,686
It tries to be formal, as in the classical moments that are ...

217
00:13:14,902 --> 00:13:15,902
Hello grandfather!

218
00:13:32,132 --> 00:13:33,260
Hello grandfather!

219
00:13:40,645 --> 00:13:41,645
Grandfather!

220
00:13:45,319 --> 00:13:46,876
What's in the shed, Becca?

221
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:58,625
According.

222
00:13:59,378 --> 00:14:01,835
I decided to say names of female pop singers,

223
00:14:01,859 --> 00:14:03,699
curse instead of saying, from now on.

224
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,270
Why?

225
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,709
I think that sounds better.

226
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:11,402
For example, if I stick a finger, I say ay Shakira!

227
00:14:13,689 --> 00:14:15,047
Oh, you're weird!

228
00:14:16,816 --> 00:14:18,088
Is everything alright?

229
00:14:18,793 --> 00:14:20,556
Yes, we are very good grandfather.

230
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,467
He had not seen her grandmother so happy in years.

231
00:14:24,286 --> 00:14:28,910
Becca, T. Diamond Stylus, we are old.

232
00:14:29,127 --> 00:14:32,733
Here we go to bed at 21:30 p. M: Yes?

233
00:14:33,884 --> 00:14:34,920
See you in the morning.

234
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:40,418
- ¿21:30 p. m.?
- Las 21:30 p. m.

235
00:14:40,893 --> 00:14:42,964
- God! - The 9:30 p.m.

236
00:14:43,479 --> 00:14:44,759
This will be fun!

237
00:14:45,106 --> 00:14:47,492
No WiFi and half past nine.

238
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:53,536
I want my cookies, I was right about toast nuts.

239
00:14:54,704 --> 00:14:56,834
Well, go have some.

240
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,640
Passed 21:30 pm I do not want to wake them.

241
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:03,212
Do not make noise, are greater, you would not hear anything.

242
00:15:04,173 --> 00:15:06,799
It has long wanted to spend some time with Grandma.

243
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:12,847
Seriously, I feel like mourn.

244
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,001
Can you teach me all these cooking tips?

245
00:15:15,025 --> 00:15:16,996
Are you aware that that was my intention?

246
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:19,775
Cursilonas hate movies, seem torturous.

247
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:21,313
That smells so good grandmother!

248
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,473
I think it looks good.

249
00:15:27,163 --> 00:15:30,249
I decided to use the soundtrack favorite musical mom.

250
00:15:30,284 --> 00:15:33,336
It's so pompous, it will be like his presence in the film.

251
00:15:33,505 --> 00:15:35,497
The counterpoint, will be more dramatic.

252
00:15:37,428 --> 00:15:39,309
It is an ironic soundtrack.

253
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:45,491
Look at me when you discuss, you're like Miss Porte, the Gymnastics.

254
00:15:45,648 --> 00:15:46,648
Oh and ...

255
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:49,901
CONSCIOUS what good is this?

256
00:15:50,778 --> 00:15:52,930
Ah, well.

257
00:15:53,823 --> 00:15:56,408
It is a gift for the girls.

258
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:09,153
I can not sleep.

259
00:16:09,221 --> 00:16:10,461
Grandma's cookies need.

260
00:16:10,765 --> 00:16:12,367
I will turn my personal addiction,

261
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:13,969
in a positive cinematic moment.

262
00:16:34,797 --> 00:16:35,797
Mom...

263
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:38,133
I will rebuild your steps when you running away ...

264
00:16:38,168 --> 00:16:40,288
Room to steal cookies to the grandmother.

265
00:17:00,123 --> 00:17:01,176
¿Tyler?

266
00:17:02,626 --> 00:17:03,841
Tyler, wake up!

267
00:17:06,964 --> 00:17:09,563
T. Diamond. The grandmother is sick.

268
00:17:12,224 --> 00:17:16,323
TUESDAY MORNING

269
00:17:17,815 --> 00:17:19,189
And that's the camera.

270
00:17:22,113 --> 00:17:24,590
Then you can upload videos to the Internet.

271
00:17:25,616 --> 00:17:27,966
I have 4 videos and rapping.

272
00:17:28,535 --> 00:17:31,225
One of them has 347 views.

273
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,782
Both are very talented.

274
00:17:35,002 --> 00:17:37,342
Do you know who Tyler the Creator?

275
00:17:37,366 --> 00:17:38,420
No.

276
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,994
Well I, I sound a bit like him.

277
00:17:41,763 --> 00:17:42,763
People say.

278
00:17:43,057 --> 00:17:45,488
Ven Becca cariño, come.

279
00:17:49,315 --> 00:17:50,315
Grandfather?

280
00:17:56,489 --> 00:17:57,489
Grandfather?

281
00:18:04,211 --> 00:18:05,234
You need me?

282
00:18:08,507 --> 00:18:10,057
Your grandmother is right.

283
00:18:11,013 --> 00:18:13,869
Last night I had a little stomach flu.

284
00:18:17,143 --> 00:18:19,342
A virus such that last 24 hrs.

285
00:18:20,438 --> 00:18:22,161
I knew it would be something.

286
00:18:25,074 --> 00:18:27,326
She is not well, Becca.

287
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:30,544
Sometimes it gets sick.

288
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:31,933
Yes of course.

289
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:35,021
¡Tyler!

290
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:40,487
The grandfather has said it may take us into town this afternoon ...

291
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:42,793
for us to record some sites you would mom.

292
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:44,704
¿Tyler?

293
00:18:50,065 --> 00:18:51,852
You can play hide below.

294
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:55,066
There are lots and visual tension.

295
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,570
Mom's place for hide and seek.

296
00:19:00,037 --> 00:19:03,194
You better hide, my ethnic confused friend.

297
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,957
One...

298
00:19:06,085 --> 00:19:07,524
Of ...

299
00:19:08,045 --> 00:19:09,582
Three ...

300
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,591
Four ...

301
00:19:12,386 --> 00:19:13,921
And five!

302
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:16,435
Ready or not, here I come!

303
00:19:25,308 --> 00:19:27,205
I see you, little fool!

304
00:19:40,174 --> 00:19:41,458
I have to use a strategy.

305
00:19:42,094 --> 00:19:45,578
It is faster, but I'm a lot smarter than him.

306
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:48,793
Here I go.

307
00:19:56,694 --> 00:19:57,835
I just spent it.

308
00:20:14,851 --> 00:20:15,851
¿Becca?

309
00:20:19,934 --> 00:20:20,955
¿Becca?

310
00:20:24,734 --> 00:20:26,513
I'm coming for you Tyler. I'm coming for you!

311
00:20:33,705 --> 00:20:34,705
¿Tyler?

312
00:20:35,423 --> 00:20:36,655
¿Tyler?

313
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:51,901
I'll catch!

314
00:20:53,473 --> 00:20:55,471
I'll catch Becca!

315
00:21:20,602 --> 00:21:22,684
I'm making chicken pie.

316
00:21:31,739 --> 00:21:33,107
What the hell was that?

317
00:21:45,511 --> 00:21:46,579
Can I help you?

318
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,271
Hi, I'm Dr. Sam.

319
00:21:49,295 --> 00:21:51,703
Working at the hospital where your grandparents volunteers collaborate.

320
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,731
You must be Becca.

321
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:55,339
Are you making a movie?

322
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,054
I used to be an actor in my time.

323
00:21:58,652 --> 00:22:02,643
Life is just a passing shadow, a poor player that struts ...

324
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:04,713
- And consume your time ... - You wanted to talk to my grandparents?

325
00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:06,647
Yes. Are they here?

326
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:10,154
No, they have gone out for a walk, I think. They just leave.

327
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:15,379
Okay, well, tell them to go to see them.

328
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:18,418
They were supposed to come from volunteers a few days ago.

329
00:22:19,096 --> 00:22:22,081
I tried to call them, just wanted to make sure they are okay.

330
00:22:23,061 --> 00:22:26,942
I think his work as volunteers stresses them a little,

331
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,497
but they will not admit it.

332
00:22:28,521 --> 00:22:29,691
They are fine!

333
00:22:30,446 --> 00:22:31,792
I am glad to hear.

334
00:22:33,325 --> 00:22:36,491
Tell them there's a lot of excitement in the hospital.

335
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,629
I can not wait to tell, I know you love gossip.

336
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:41,821
I will tell you, nice to meet you.

337
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:47,188
24:15 Saturday.

338
00:22:47,385 --> 00:22:51,199
Tyler Jamison, better known by the girls as T. Diamond Stylus.

339
00:22:51,242 --> 00:22:52,704
Investigate there in the shed.

340
00:22:53,853 --> 00:22:57,873
It is an isolated farmhouse, with people hanging.

341
00:23:00,237 --> 00:23:01,625
Are there dead bodies?

342
00:23:03,784 --> 00:23:05,306
Are there dead bodies?

343
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:09,579
There will be dead!

344
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,319
I go into the shed.

345
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:00,802
Here smells like ass.

346
00:24:14,922 --> 00:24:17,620
I am approaching the suspect lots.

347
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:30,873
Oh, shit!

348
00:24:35,325 --> 00:24:36,325
Oh, damn it!

349
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:41,268
¡Ay, Sarah McLachlan!

350
00:24:43,624 --> 00:24:44,668
Tyler.

351
00:24:45,627 --> 00:24:47,293
What the hell grandmother?

352
00:24:49,383 --> 00:24:52,162
Your grandfather has incontinence.

353
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:55,502
Hides his "accidents" in the shed.

354
00:24:55,847 --> 00:24:58,818
And then I think the field burning.

355
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:02,883
It is a virile man who is ashamed.

356
00:25:05,321 --> 00:25:08,354
You must be disappointed with your grandparents!

357
00:25:08,951 --> 00:25:11,263
I feel that ruined things!

358
00:25:11,998 --> 00:25:13,598
Really we tried.

359
00:25:16,004 --> 00:25:17,784
I'll make bread pudding.

360
00:25:20,512 --> 00:25:21,881
We are fine?

361
00:25:25,435 --> 00:25:27,481
Yes, if I'm right, Grandma.

362
00:25:29,314 --> 00:25:30,314
Good.

363
00:25:31,481 --> 00:25:34,311
My mom is a character in the classic narrative.

364
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,557
He says things like "things do not go well for me!"

365
00:25:37,575 --> 00:25:38,575
And then makes pass.

366
00:25:39,033 --> 00:25:43,710
You need the elixir or all of your relationships fail.

367
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,167
¿Becca?

368
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:50,641
Grandfather, we often play a game of pointing a building ...

369
00:25:50,665 --> 00:25:53,240
and we must say who lives there, and what they do in secret.

370
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:55,612
Becca, with the commissioner.

371
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,413
A police officer named Jerry, works there.

372
00:26:01,003 --> 00:26:04,597
But he never come to work, or answer the phone.

373
00:26:04,621 --> 00:26:08,330
Because, what you really like to be is a dancer.

374
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:10,847
Okay, it's my turn.

375
00:26:11,495 --> 00:26:13,538
That big brick building back there,

376
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:14,924
It is a factory of slippers.

377
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,148
And it works a woman named Sally.

378
00:26:16,183 --> 00:26:17,783
That's the Maple Shed hospital, actually.

379
00:26:19,006 --> 00:26:21,229
Yeah, Mom told us to work as volunteers.

380
00:26:21,253 --> 00:26:22,967
Yes, every Tuesday and Thursday.

381
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:26,963
They are good people, but they have no one to care for them.

382
00:26:28,308 --> 00:26:31,068
I'll find my pass Maple Shed and make them a visit.

383
00:26:31,648 --> 00:26:33,576
SECUNDARIA MASONVILLE

384
00:26:35,736 --> 00:26:39,402
Join us on a journey into the past Loretta Young Jamison.

385
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:41,725
This was the Secondary Loretta Young.

386
00:26:42,328 --> 00:26:45,779
Loretta Young and her friends used to stay close to this sign ...

387
00:26:47,418 --> 00:26:49,332
Now we'll go to the back.

388
00:26:49,356 --> 00:26:52,119
At a glimpse, the room, the young rebel Loretta,

389
00:26:52,154 --> 00:26:53,369
through a window.

390
00:26:54,178 --> 00:26:56,330
Mom grandfather was a good student?

391
00:26:56,354 --> 00:27:00,036
We have to go, such is watching us.

392
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:03,935
- We do not, no, grandfather watches. - Fuck, it has stopped.

393
00:27:04,485 --> 00:27:06,748
- Grandfather? - Pretend you're not watching.

394
00:27:06,772 --> 00:27:09,122
What are you doing? Grandfather for!

395
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,378
Hey, stop following me!

396
00:27:11,575 --> 00:27:13,472
- No, no, stop. - Stop following me!

397
00:27:13,496 --> 00:27:14,696
I'm not following man!

398
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,697
- Stop following me! - Grandfather!

399
00:27:17,976 --> 00:27:19,901
- Grandfather? You get hurt. - I'll split the ...

400
00:27:19,903 --> 00:27:21,404
- Quítateme me! - Hey!

401
00:27:22,425 --> 00:27:24,149
- But what is your problem? - Tyler.

402
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,425
Grandpa does not know you.

403
00:27:28,391 --> 00:27:29,391
Oh man!

404
00:27:29,829 --> 00:27:31,315
I'm sick.

405
00:27:32,271 --> 00:27:33,670
I'm fine, I ...

406
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,656
I'm sorry.

407
00:27:37,695 --> 00:27:40,414
That was insane! It is as strong as a wrestler.

408
00:27:40,438 --> 00:27:41,511
This increased.

409
00:27:41,552 --> 00:27:43,944
Confused, do not panic!

410
00:27:44,451 --> 00:27:46,359
Most people become paranoid and is a ...

411
00:27:46,394 --> 00:27:48,314
field type, spends his days chopping wood.

412
00:27:55,419 --> 00:27:57,699
Hey would you not talk about it?

413
00:28:39,072 --> 00:28:40,338
What is that?

414
00:28:42,158 --> 00:28:44,453
Okay, we believe that there is someone outside the door.

415
00:28:44,743 --> 00:28:46,139
It's 10:47 p.m.

416
00:28:47,664 --> 00:28:48,744
Becca opens the door.

417
00:28:50,585 --> 00:28:51,585
No way.

418
00:28:52,796 --> 00:28:54,196
Okay, you still recording this.

419
00:29:04,105 --> 00:29:05,809
Come on, let's see what's out there.

420
00:29:09,402 --> 00:29:10,815
No, something is wrong.

421
00:29:11,145 --> 00:29:12,549
I'll open the door Becca.

422
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:18,301
- I'll open the door and Becca. - I do not think you should.

423
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,493
There I go, I will open the door.

424
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,785
Open it. Why do you keep talking about it?

425
00:29:35,712 --> 00:29:37,347
¡Only ciérrala, only ciérrala!

426
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,118
Jesus Becca, I'm blind.

427
00:29:45,076 --> 00:29:48,760
Wednesday morning

428
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:49,916
Grandfather?

429
00:29:52,921 --> 00:29:53,943
Grandfather?

430
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:59,464
I'll tell you the truth, I have been diagnosed with the disorder.

431
00:30:00,013 --> 00:30:02,231
Apparently, many older people suffer.

432
00:30:03,393 --> 00:30:05,317
Why vomits it?

433
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:07,667
Okay...

434
00:30:08,317 --> 00:30:11,303
Sometimes he puts into his head that has eaten something.

435
00:30:11,612 --> 00:30:13,869
And ... that is inside it.

436
00:30:15,785 --> 00:30:17,585
And trying to get out.

437
00:30:18,246 --> 00:30:21,368
It's called Evening syndrome, is a type of dementia.

438
00:30:21,665 --> 00:30:23,448
It happens after dark.

439
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:25,093
Is it true?

440
00:30:25,463 --> 00:30:29,126
It's like when someone talks in his sleep, so they explained to me at least.

441
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,060
Better you get as standard ...

442
00:30:32,224 --> 00:30:33,944
not to leave your room later ...

443
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:35,877
21:30 pm What you Agree?

444
00:30:37,482 --> 00:30:38,684
We agree?

445
00:30:39,068 --> 00:30:41,277
Yeah, yeah, okay.

446
00:30:41,301 --> 00:30:42,638
Sorry for this.

447
00:30:43,531 --> 00:30:45,104
I guess you're not happy now.

448
00:30:45,574 --> 00:30:49,895
Nothing happens grandfather, I'm fine, just we'll be here until Saturday.

449
00:30:51,752 --> 00:30:53,532
You're going, you're going somewhere?

450
00:30:53,556 --> 00:30:55,832
If, to take the train to the costume party.

451
00:31:01,254 --> 00:31:04,470
Grandpa do I create that you're confusing?

452
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,738
Oh man!

453
00:31:11,414 --> 00:31:12,584
Oh man!

454
00:31:14,155 --> 00:31:17,729
Well, that old pair of confused proved your grandparents!

455
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:19,602
Okay, nothing happens.

456
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,327
- Do not worry. - Do not.

457
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:24,860
- All right. According? - Yeah, okay.

458
00:31:24,884 --> 00:31:25,884
Nothing happens.

459
00:31:25,963 --> 00:31:27,691
Cecil B. DeMille good morning.

460
00:31:28,383 --> 00:31:30,228
He was a great director.

461
00:31:31,303 --> 00:31:33,602
I've made cheese biscuits, honey.

462
00:31:35,976 --> 00:31:39,577
Already he was preparing the old, to the costume party again?

463
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,250
Yes it is.

464
00:31:41,736 --> 00:31:43,109
He's crazy.

465
00:31:44,073 --> 00:31:47,786
I'm going to do something barn, slow one minute.

466
00:31:50,372 --> 00:31:52,633
Step something with your computer.

467
00:31:53,835 --> 00:31:58,625
I dropped some dough on top, try cleaning with a solvent.

468
00:31:59,131 --> 00:32:00,296
I'm sorry.

469
00:32:03,597 --> 00:32:05,327
It is rare during the day.

470
00:32:05,432 --> 00:32:08,835
- And more rarita overnight. - I tell you, nothing happens.

471
00:32:09,105 --> 00:32:11,635
Search the Internet for the definition Evening Syndrome.

472
00:32:11,659 --> 00:32:14,575
Sure you do not understand almost nothing, is not language rapper.

473
00:32:14,738 --> 00:32:18,203
It is a neurological reaction to the sun and moon.

474
00:32:18,284 --> 00:32:20,551
It is literally a chemical reaction.

475
00:32:20,871 --> 00:32:24,571
Evening syndrome describes the disorientation, agitation ...

476
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:26,674
or general deterioration of mental deterioration ...

477
00:32:26,935 --> 00:32:29,126
own old age at dusk or dark.

478
00:32:29,591 --> 00:32:31,716
It is very common among older people.

479
00:32:32,473 --> 00:32:34,478
The old people are afraid for no reason.

480
00:32:34,513 --> 00:32:36,047
And what about the computer?

481
00:32:36,403 --> 00:32:38,543
Only computer crashed camera.

482
00:32:38,578 --> 00:32:39,754
Here's something else.

483
00:32:39,856 --> 00:32:45,058
The clean with a cleanser and now through the camera can not see anything.

484
00:32:45,113 --> 00:32:46,841
Is not that a little weird?

485
00:32:47,197 --> 00:32:48,562
Erred.

486
00:32:48,658 --> 00:32:51,799
When you accept you are older, it will not seem so strange.

487
00:32:53,664 --> 00:32:57,773
We are on deck, Miguel is a contest of hairy chests.

488
00:32:57,797 --> 00:32:59,286
They are smearing oil.

489
00:33:01,592 --> 00:33:03,463
It's strange not to see them.

490
00:33:04,973 --> 00:33:06,298
I think I can clean.

491
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:08,040
Tyler, why are you so quiet?

492
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,086
Grandparents are a little strange.

493
00:33:14,401 --> 00:33:16,810
How rare? ¿Becca, have rubbed off on Tyler?

494
00:33:17,991 --> 00:33:18,991
No.

495
00:33:20,326 --> 00:33:21,507
Guys?

496
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:26,696
Grandfather in diapers and stored in a shed.

497
00:33:26,721 --> 00:33:28,346
And the grandmother wanders naked ...

498
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,370
and grandfather believes strangers haunt you.

499
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:35,950
I knew this would happen, Tyler age.

500
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:37,420
I have discussed it with him.

501
00:33:37,444 --> 00:33:38,438
Older people sometimes have ...

502
00:33:38,473 --> 00:33:39,833
problems with their bodies, sometimes.

503
00:33:39,894 --> 00:33:42,756
They are not aware of what they do and become paranoid.

504
00:33:43,105 --> 00:33:44,872
Becca what extent the look weird?

505
00:33:44,907 --> 00:33:46,638
They have never been bad for a second.

506
00:33:46,863 --> 00:33:48,823
The grandmother chased us crawling under the house.

507
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:49,873
We played hide and seek.

508
00:33:49,897 --> 00:33:51,974
They played hide and seek under the house loved me!

509
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:54,729
- Oh Carrie Underwood. - Yes, can withstand a couple of more days.

510
00:33:54,874 --> 00:33:56,426
My parents were rare in young people.

511
00:33:56,461 --> 00:33:57,934
My mother was a hippie, used to take ...

512
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,929
the sun naked in the garden, without telling anyone.

513
00:34:00,036 --> 00:34:01,609
I'm already half blind.

514
00:34:01,644 --> 00:34:04,404
I cringed, are just weird people love.

515
00:34:05,245 --> 00:34:06,846
What level would be the problem?

516
00:34:08,059 --> 00:34:09,059
One.

517
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,520
One.

518
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:12,730
You see.

519
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:14,230
I miss you guys!

520
00:34:16,946 --> 00:34:19,353
I think it will start the contest hairy chests,

521
00:34:19,388 --> 00:34:21,235
maduronas hear all applauding.

522
00:34:21,868 --> 00:34:25,078
I have to go, I wish I could see their faces clearly.

523
00:34:54,038 --> 00:34:55,255
Hello Darling.

524
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:03,777
Grandma can I ask you about Mom?

525
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,579
Do you think you could talk a minute, during an interview?

526
00:35:32,671 --> 00:35:36,194
Would you care to get inside the oven to clean it?

527
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:39,669
¿Pe ... Sorry?

528
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:42,944
I am big, I do not get back.

529
00:35:44,313 --> 00:35:46,484
The kitchen must be clean.

530
00:35:49,196 --> 00:35:50,476
The oven is turned off.

531
00:35:52,742 --> 00:35:55,230
Yes of course. Yes of course.

532
00:36:05,926 --> 00:36:07,556
Slip deeper.

533
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,686
In all.

534
00:36:31,544 --> 00:36:34,699
Okay, I'll be out in your film.

535
00:36:38,346 --> 00:36:41,580
If you could be any animal what would you choose?

536
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,360
Is there a right answer?

537
00:36:43,978 --> 00:36:46,968
No, these questions are for you to relax.

538
00:36:51,495 --> 00:36:52,805
Un oso Grizzly.

539
00:36:54,532 --> 00:36:55,870
I think you're ready.

540
00:36:56,909 --> 00:36:59,908
Mom told me that you and Grandpa were very much in love.

541
00:37:01,001 --> 00:37:02,546
Where did you meet Grandpa?

542
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:05,623
In a garden.

543
00:37:06,092 --> 00:37:07,729
And what did you think of him?

544
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,041
He was very handsome.

545
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:13,982
It has a very strong personality.

546
00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:16,153
This is great.

547
00:37:17,105 --> 00:37:18,653
Then we go back to that.

548
00:37:18,877 --> 00:37:21,567
Now I want to talk about something else.

549
00:37:21,903 --> 00:37:23,892
I know it was long ago,

550
00:37:23,927 --> 00:37:26,568
But what happened the day that Mom left?

551
00:37:28,581 --> 00:37:29,828
She will not tell me.

552
00:37:34,087 --> 00:37:35,633
Did you do anything?

553
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,936
Grandma? Grandma!

554
00:37:42,931 --> 00:37:45,367
Grandma, do not answer that question.

555
00:37:51,904 --> 00:37:54,535
No more questions about Loretta Jamison.

556
00:37:56,284 --> 00:37:59,441
- Maybe I could ask you ... - I do not want to go out in your film!

557
00:38:00,748 --> 00:38:04,717
Okay, Wednesday night, stay 3 nights.

558
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:09,688
T. Diamond Stylus, will discover exactly is going on.

559
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,735
What are you doing?

560
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,834
I'll leave the camera here tonight, okay?

561
00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:16,779
It is as if we were living with the werewolf.

562
00:38:16,913 --> 00:38:18,137
You can not record it.

563
00:38:18,198 --> 00:38:18,865
A un lado.

564
00:38:18,888 --> 00:38:20,703
Look, I know you do not understand because the brain ...

565
00:38:20,738 --> 00:38:22,098
It has not been fully developed like.

566
00:38:22,236 --> 00:38:24,549
- But you can not do this! - Why?

567
00:38:25,697 --> 00:38:27,839
Because I have my film principles.

568
00:38:28,034 --> 00:38:31,450
No, no one gives a shit about your film principles.

569
00:38:31,474 --> 00:38:33,210
According? We're not in the 18th century.

570
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:34,995
Have you seen a Reality?

571
00:38:35,254 --> 00:38:37,032
That housewives of Houston,

572
00:38:37,067 --> 00:38:38,811
It has as millions of viewers.

573
00:38:38,835 --> 00:38:41,435
If one of them does not participate in the scene, we can not burn!

574
00:38:41,721 --> 00:38:44,892
It is unethical. With all due respect to whoever had the idea ...

575
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,630
Reality of the housewives of Houston.

576
00:38:46,695 --> 00:38:49,741
You think you pretty cool right?

577
00:38:57,241 --> 00:38:59,181
I hope things will not put more rare.

578
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,349
Because I'm on the edge.

579
00:39:10,135 --> 00:39:11,980
Teaches the clock. I teach it.

580
00:39:14,931 --> 00:39:16,990
This is what I was talking grandfather.

581
00:39:19,062 --> 00:39:20,998
- The werewolf is real. - Wait!

582
00:39:22,483 --> 00:39:23,669
It is Vespertino Syndrome.

583
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:27,515
We are participating in this. And it is not...

584
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:29,419
Reality no housewives on Houston.

585
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:34,992
Wait, if you want to open the door, open it, but only a moment.

586
00:40:32,204 --> 00:40:35,731
- Is it normal to do that? - It's like when someone talks in his sleep.

587
00:40:35,878 --> 00:40:38,187
You used to talk sleep up to 7 years.

588
00:40:38,457 --> 00:40:40,379
Dad came to calm down.

589
00:40:48,852 --> 00:40:52,782
Thursday morning

590
00:41:06,105 --> 00:41:07,105
Hey Becca ...

591
00:41:09,211 --> 00:41:10,215
Who I am?

592
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:19,707
¿T.? ¿T.?

593
00:41:21,797 --> 00:41:22,877
¿T.?

594
00:41:25,195 --> 00:41:28,928
There is a family of foxes, they're going to lose.

595
00:41:29,282 --> 00:41:30,609
Now come on!

596
00:41:34,798 --> 00:41:36,102
Just stop!

597
00:41:44,467 --> 00:41:46,209
Does the grandmother is looking into the well?

598
00:41:46,302 --> 00:41:47,715
Come, let's go.

599
00:41:49,308 --> 00:41:50,501
I do not know.

600
00:41:59,404 --> 00:42:00,871
The staging.

601
00:42:01,774 --> 00:42:04,014
Do you know? You're not as dumb as they seem ...

602
00:42:04,049 --> 00:42:06,822
reflect school performance test.

603
00:42:08,669 --> 00:42:10,403
I forgot I had something for you.

604
00:42:16,637 --> 00:42:21,660
When you think of Dad, now, in California, you still like him?

605
00:42:22,812 --> 00:42:24,732
I do not know, they are things that happen.

606
00:42:25,316 --> 00:42:27,723
But dad is hilarious.

607
00:42:27,727 --> 00:42:30,534
It's fun, he sent us that funny card with that fat.

608
00:42:31,447 --> 00:42:32,588
Do you remember that?

609
00:42:33,241 --> 00:42:35,087
What do you mean by "these things happen"?

610
00:42:37,915 --> 00:42:39,057
People are going ...

611
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,258
because they find something they like better.

612
00:42:43,924 --> 00:42:45,940
And it does not make you feel bad?

613
00:42:47,344 --> 00:42:48,344
No.

614
00:42:50,348 --> 00:42:51,775
You're not being honest.

615
00:42:53,395 --> 00:42:56,560
You can believe whatever you want, but that's what I feel.

616
00:42:58,402 --> 00:42:59,888
Convince me!

617
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:09,310
I'm with the Titans, the children's football team, was third down.

618
00:43:09,877 --> 00:43:12,425
It's almost the end and we are winning.

619
00:43:12,629 --> 00:43:14,932
If they stop, probably we win the game.

620
00:43:15,103 --> 00:43:16,954
Give me the context. How old were you?

621
00:43:17,742 --> 00:43:18,828
I was 8 years.

622
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,314
According. I am the link above.

623
00:43:23,018 --> 00:43:25,555
And that means I have to tackling the contrary ...

624
00:43:25,913 --> 00:43:28,153
if he tries to pass the ball to people online.

625
00:43:28,568 --> 00:43:30,562
So run, hits the ball.

626
00:43:30,586 --> 00:43:32,254
Wait, what am I supposed to understand these terms?

627
00:43:32,532 --> 00:43:35,090
Do these sentences are supposed to mean something to me?

628
00:43:35,095 --> 00:43:36,098
You listen.

629
00:43:37,747 --> 00:43:39,683
And run and is very large ...

630
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:43,902
and exceeds the line and I'm the only one who can taclearle.

631
00:43:43,963 --> 00:43:45,647
Only I have to tackle him, I put my hands ...

632
00:43:45,701 --> 00:43:47,100
and as I tackle him, but ...

633
00:43:50,223 --> 00:43:51,586
I stood there.

634
00:43:53,185 --> 00:43:56,317
I froze and listened to all screaming.

635
00:43:56,690 --> 00:44:00,150
Dougherty coach, dad, my teammates.

636
00:44:01,822 --> 00:44:04,234
He runs and runs with the ball.

637
00:44:04,258 --> 00:44:07,806
And the other team already is celebrating and standing there.

638
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:12,894
At the same place.

639
00:44:15,756 --> 00:44:17,889
He came the coach for me.

640
00:44:18,634 --> 00:44:21,201
Dad patted me the man and went to the car.

641
00:44:21,932 --> 00:44:24,315
And he said that he was angry or anything.

642
00:44:26,854 --> 00:44:29,427
Do you think dad left us without saying anything ...

643
00:44:29,451 --> 00:44:32,070
why not another player tacleaste 8 years ...

644
00:44:32,094 --> 00:44:33,101
5 years ago?

645
00:44:37,581 --> 00:44:40,532
Well, That sounds pretty stupid.

646
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:48,154
Why are we here?

647
00:44:48,802 --> 00:44:50,194
She was looking at something.

648
00:44:59,815 --> 00:45:01,890
So what have you found?

649
00:45:04,488 --> 00:45:05,681
It's just water.

650
00:45:11,122 --> 00:45:13,037
So just I read these in order?

651
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:19,430
If you could be any animal, what would you be?

652
00:45:19,454 --> 00:45:21,214
- I feel like a moron Becca. - Shut!

653
00:45:22,095 --> 00:45:23,433
It would be a dolphin.

654
00:45:23,556 --> 00:45:26,101
It is an intuitive and intelligent creature.

655
00:45:26,103 --> 00:45:28,214
That follows poetry and strength in their movements.

656
00:45:29,482 --> 00:45:31,645
How can you like the pizza delivery?

657
00:45:31,735 --> 00:45:34,139
With all that face full of acne?

658
00:45:38,537 --> 00:45:40,315
Please answer the question.

659
00:45:45,169 --> 00:45:46,354
He is friendly.

660
00:45:47,963 --> 00:45:49,394
He has kind eyes.

661
00:45:53,014 --> 00:45:55,132
Why did not you look in the mirror?

662
00:45:57,104 --> 00:46:00,137
According what's all that?

663
00:46:00,482 --> 00:46:03,630
Except when editing. Whenever you view yourself.

664
00:46:04,071 --> 00:46:05,687
You never look in the mirror.

665
00:46:05,722 --> 00:46:08,388
You comb your hair back to the mirror.

666
00:46:08,412 --> 00:46:10,052
And I saw you when you brush your teeth.

667
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:12,410
Look down all the time.

668
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,512
You wear your sweater backwards you know that?

669
00:46:21,468 --> 00:46:23,588
Is not that you have not looked in the mirror this morning?

670
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,277
I am right?

671
00:46:31,815 --> 00:46:33,615
Not feeling well right?

672
00:46:36,444 --> 00:46:38,702
Are you changing the focal length?

673
00:46:40,076 --> 00:46:41,786
No, I do not even know what that is.

674
00:46:42,081 --> 00:46:43,232
Do you do zoom?

675
00:46:44,751 --> 00:46:46,010
No.

676
00:46:50,133 --> 00:46:53,813
Will you admit that you do not look at yourself ...

677
00:46:53,837 --> 00:46:54,957
Or will you keep lying?

678
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,651
When do you think I started doing it?

679
00:46:58,895 --> 00:47:00,014
You know when.

680
00:47:02,483 --> 00:47:04,411
That's not true idiot.

681
00:47:05,653 --> 00:47:07,210
You think worthless.

682
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:09,604
Admit it.

683
00:47:18,553 --> 00:47:20,898
He gave me a card when he left.

684
00:47:24,303 --> 00:47:25,446
A card.

685
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:33,713
The videos that have small ...

686
00:47:35,235 --> 00:47:37,387
I thought to use them in the film.

687
00:47:39,075 --> 00:47:41,748
But I refuse to put pictures with my dad in them.

688
00:47:43,662 --> 00:47:45,236
Mean forgive him.

689
00:47:54,512 --> 00:47:55,566
Grandma?

690
00:48:00,228 --> 00:48:01,255
Grandma?

691
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,186
Becca, this blind.

692
00:48:11,492 --> 00:48:12,851
I know I'm right.

693
00:48:13,786 --> 00:48:15,554
Something is happening here.

694
00:48:19,378 --> 00:48:21,920
Perhaps there is something in the basement!

695
00:48:22,758 --> 00:48:26,158
They do not want to go down there! I was being altered.

696
00:48:26,597 --> 00:48:27,906
Speaks in English.

697
00:48:28,307 --> 00:48:30,387
They could be hiding something down there.

698
00:48:30,768 --> 00:48:34,092
They said mold, so do not want to go down.

699
00:48:34,363 --> 00:48:35,800
And let it okay?

700
00:48:36,068 --> 00:48:38,469
Let me just let the camera placed.

701
00:48:43,162 --> 00:48:47,245
Hi, I'm Stacey Are Mr. and Mrs. Jamison?

702
00:48:47,269 --> 00:48:50,510
No, just out, we are just my brother and me here.

703
00:48:51,756 --> 00:48:55,313
Mr. and Mrs. Jamison were volunteers in midow Group.

704
00:48:55,348 --> 00:48:57,188
I was in a rehabilitation program there.

705
00:48:57,555 --> 00:49:00,855
They used to sit by my bed when I was wrong.

706
00:49:01,018 --> 00:49:02,920
Sometimes all night.

707
00:49:03,821 --> 00:49:06,611
Well, I have come to bring a cake of blackberries.

708
00:49:07,001 --> 00:49:08,950
They had to stop by there on Saturday.

709
00:49:09,006 --> 00:49:10,235
But they never appeared.

710
00:49:10,541 --> 00:49:12,592
I know that Mrs. Jamison was not feeling well,

711
00:49:12,724 --> 00:49:15,750
so I wanted to come to see how it was.

712
00:49:15,932 --> 00:49:18,303
Have you heard all the gossip in Maple Shed?

713
00:49:18,825 --> 00:49:20,229
I think not.

714
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:26,915
Stacey quiet, is natural, I'm shooting everyone.

715
00:49:28,224 --> 00:49:29,482
Solo sé natural.

716
00:49:31,352 --> 00:49:32,732
Well never mind.

717
00:49:54,966 --> 00:49:56,028
Grandfather?

718
00:50:13,826 --> 00:50:14,936
Grandfather?

719
00:50:20,294 --> 00:50:21,576
Now we're even.

720
00:50:25,842 --> 00:50:27,920
I've been making music assembly.

721
00:50:27,944 --> 00:50:30,217
But I need more shots of everyday life of the grandparents.

722
00:50:30,281 --> 00:50:33,000
So I'll follow them Thursday afternoon.

723
00:50:34,418 --> 00:50:37,495
Do you hear that? He is laughing watching TV.

724
00:50:37,504 --> 00:50:39,559
Perhaps for the same programs as mother.

725
00:51:01,891 --> 00:51:02,993
Grandma?

726
00:51:03,911 --> 00:51:05,622
Grandma are you okay?

727
00:51:07,649 --> 00:51:09,355
Good afternoon.

728
00:51:10,579 --> 00:51:12,018
I heard that you laughed.

729
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,013
I have a dark attack.

730
00:51:25,547 --> 00:51:27,367
Grandma! Grandma!

731
00:51:27,391 --> 00:51:29,790
Grandma! Grandma! For! For Grandma!

732
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:38,106
What's wrong with Grandma?

733
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:44,188
You have to laugh, to lock up the darkness in a cave.

734
00:51:52,918 --> 00:51:54,136
Grandfather?

735
00:52:00,445 --> 00:52:01,906
Grandfather? I think Grandma ...

736
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:02,930
I was just cleaning.

737
00:52:03,399 --> 00:52:04,508
What is that?

738
00:52:05,152 --> 00:52:06,369
Did you want something?

739
00:52:07,887 --> 00:52:09,324
I was just cleaning, seriously.

740
00:52:10,568 --> 00:52:13,458
I think, I think the grandmother is not feeling well.

741
00:52:17,702 --> 00:52:19,753
Thanks Becca, I'll go see it.

742
00:52:26,289 --> 00:52:28,172
Tonight we put the camera.

743
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:39,954
How about?

744
00:52:54,751 --> 00:52:57,730
- Well girls! - That's right, I'm bad, I'm bad.

745
00:52:58,164 --> 00:53:00,400
It looks like this much better without us.

746
00:53:01,436 --> 00:53:02,937
I LOVE! - We do so mom has its own life.

747
00:53:03,037 --> 00:53:04,037
¡Tonto!

748
00:53:05,016 --> 00:53:06,784
MIGUEL MOM + - Now we really perfect people.

749
00:53:06,867 --> 00:53:09,530
Here we go, from the beginning. Here we go.

750
00:53:09,562 --> 00:53:10,868
SEE YOU SOON!

751
00:53:11,425 --> 00:53:12,842
Good evening!

752
00:53:12,866 --> 00:53:14,518
All good?

753
00:53:14,654 --> 00:53:15,874
We are fine.

754
00:53:15,906 --> 00:53:17,130
¿Safe?

755
00:53:17,949 --> 00:53:19,919
They're both a little strange.

756
00:53:20,452 --> 00:53:23,460
We are great, really. Thanks for asking.

757
00:53:23,484 --> 00:53:25,386
- According. - Good evening!

758
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,298
Good evening.

759
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,901
- What I am going to do? - What's up?

760
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,171
There were no tissues in the bathroom ...

761
00:53:42,195 --> 00:53:43,644
I had to touch the toilet seat.

762
00:53:43,692 --> 00:53:45,662
- And now I have something in my hand! - Here, let me ...

763
00:53:45,686 --> 00:53:47,420
It does not look, but I can feel it.

764
00:53:47,856 --> 00:53:50,880
- Tyler, Tyler. - It's disgusting, it is not removed.

765
00:53:50,904 --> 00:53:52,247
- Do not remove. - Wait, let me look.

766
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:54,996
I can feel it. There are scarves Becca!

767
00:53:55,166 --> 00:53:57,230
Tyler had handkerchiefs under the sink.

768
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:58,755
Where? Than?

769
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,856
- Peace man. - Too late, not be removed.

770
00:54:02,427 --> 00:54:04,428
Rubbing can not be removed.

771
00:54:04,881 --> 00:54:06,666
It's okay, okay.

772
00:54:07,474 --> 00:54:10,290
- I still feel. - It is already going, look.

773
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:14,823
It is taking quite definitely.

774
00:54:15,987 --> 00:54:17,823
- Safe? - It is done!

775
00:54:20,244 --> 00:54:22,109
- You see? - Yes.

776
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,493
Next time look good right?

777
00:54:24,517 --> 00:54:25,957
- It is done. - I did not know it was there.

778
00:56:33,164 --> 00:56:34,202
¿Becca?

779
00:56:44,899 --> 00:56:46,647
Stay in bed.

780
00:57:08,512 --> 00:57:12,945
Friday morning

781
00:57:29,861 --> 00:57:32,041
Mom comes home this afternoon.

782
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,564
We will leave here today.

783
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,454
Stay away from them. If I do not tell you.

784
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:40,883
Pack your bags.

785
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:49,544
You still have to give your mom elixir.

786
00:57:50,843 --> 00:57:52,970
Becca what is the "elixir"?

787
00:57:57,185 --> 00:57:58,889
Pretend we're playing.

788
00:58:00,106 --> 00:58:01,780
Everything is alright?

789
00:58:02,192 --> 00:58:03,706
We are playing.

790
00:58:09,325 --> 00:58:11,086
Do you want me to do the interview?

791
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:12,805
Than? What are you doing?

792
00:58:13,164 --> 00:58:15,260
We said no acercáramos Becca.

793
00:58:15,284 --> 00:58:16,684
Are you going to do an interview with him?

794
00:58:25,012 --> 00:58:27,866
Mom told me you worked in the coal industry long.

795
00:58:29,978 --> 00:58:31,863
Work in a factory.

796
00:58:32,105 --> 00:58:33,415
I know.

797
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:35,463
He worked nights.

798
00:58:36,525 --> 00:58:38,748
He saw a white creature hanging around.

799
00:58:40,528 --> 00:58:41,668
A white creature?

800
00:58:41,737 --> 00:58:43,789
If, he haunted by the factory at night.

801
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:47,345
I just saw her.

802
00:58:48,249 --> 00:58:52,304
I told the others, but no one believed me.

803
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,146
His yellow eyes.

804
00:58:58,095 --> 00:58:59,738
Then they fired me.

805
00:59:01,682 --> 00:59:03,571
And everyone stopped talking.

806
00:59:07,982 --> 00:59:09,529
Mom had told me no.

807
00:59:09,943 --> 00:59:13,249
She does not know, then he steps that was.

808
00:59:17,996 --> 00:59:19,626
Grandfather, sad look.

809
00:59:21,581 --> 00:59:23,117
Well, it's just ...

810
00:59:25,044 --> 00:59:26,818
just because your trip soon.

811
00:59:29,715 --> 00:59:31,597
I know that everything comes to an end.

812
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:37,817
Why do not you ask mom if you can come visit?

813
00:59:39,229 --> 00:59:40,995
Are you still angry?

814
00:59:48,364 --> 00:59:51,167
You can not overcome it, because they believe still angry with her.

815
01:00:00,005 --> 01:00:02,968
The white creature that makes me the willies.

816
01:00:03,463 --> 01:00:06,652
No doubt it is a principle of schizophrenia.

817
01:00:06,715 --> 01:00:07,899
Both are very bad.

818
01:00:08,359 --> 01:00:09,371
Brilliant!

819
01:00:09,408 --> 01:00:11,257
Grandpa has schizophrenia and grandmother ...

820
01:00:11,292 --> 01:00:13,384
Michael Myers becomes when the sun sets.

821
01:00:21,187 --> 01:00:22,451
Es Stacey.

822
01:00:22,486 --> 01:00:23,610
Why did not they come?

823
01:00:24,775 --> 01:00:25,957
Okay, stop ...

824
01:00:27,372 --> 01:00:29,633
Why you are angry?

825
01:00:31,225 --> 01:00:33,185
We will be saying they need to get help.

826
01:00:34,254 --> 01:00:35,557
I do not...

827
01:00:35,713 --> 01:00:38,787
Come back.

828
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:41,385
I need to show you something.

829
01:00:42,765 --> 01:00:43,951
Good.

830
01:00:46,354 --> 01:00:47,731
I've already cleaned.

831
01:00:48,431 --> 01:00:50,277
No he visto marcharse a Stacey.

832
01:00:50,902 --> 01:00:52,078
And you?

833
01:00:55,992 --> 01:00:57,742
Grandma says it's okay.

834
01:01:01,329 --> 01:01:04,486
Thanks for making it, we'll soon grandmother.

835
01:01:05,084 --> 01:01:07,222
Me da pena que se termine.

836
01:01:07,547 --> 01:01:10,061
It is the last time I can ask you questions.

837
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:14,784
It's like the grand finale of my film and like you said, you're the star.

838
01:01:17,235 --> 01:01:20,166
Tell me anything you want to tell.

839
01:01:20,249 --> 01:01:23,701
I know a story about the water.

840
01:01:24,023 --> 01:01:25,023
Brilliant!

841
01:01:26,643 --> 01:01:28,686
There is a pond ...

842
01:01:28,696 --> 01:01:30,784
with little creatures inside.

843
01:01:32,232 --> 01:01:36,371
The creatures are from another planet, but no one notices.

844
01:01:37,491 --> 01:01:41,742
These creatures spit in the water all day.

845
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:46,572
Their saliva let you sleep, but not kill.

846
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,096
When people are immersed in the pond ...

847
01:01:51,308 --> 01:01:53,894
They fall into a deep sleep.

848
01:01:54,845 --> 01:01:57,198
A truly beautiful dream.

849
01:01:58,649 --> 01:02:03,433
Creatures from another planet have so many people in the pond bottom.

850
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:05,841
The stored.

851
01:02:06,579 --> 01:02:11,736
They plan to take them one day to his planet called Synmorfitelia.

852
01:02:16,914 --> 01:02:18,951
It's just a made-up story.

853
01:02:18,975 --> 01:02:20,129
No es real.

854
01:02:20,429 --> 01:02:22,780
Wow, that's an incredible story!

855
01:02:22,804 --> 01:02:27,443
And the creatures have antennas, but are invisible antennae.

856
01:02:32,561 --> 01:02:34,216
Can we talk to Mom?

857
01:02:38,949 --> 01:02:40,738
You do not want to see her?

858
01:02:44,532 --> 01:02:45,818
No.

859
01:02:46,617 --> 01:02:47,804
Never.

860
01:02:48,462 --> 01:02:53,426
The day he left, he had to do something ...

861
01:02:58,007 --> 01:02:59,660
Okay, okay, let's pretend ...

862
01:02:59,695 --> 01:03:01,312
we are telling a different story.

863
01:03:02,971 --> 01:03:06,661
And history ... is a young ...

864
01:03:06,885 --> 01:03:09,397
he believes in love with an older man.

865
01:03:09,774 --> 01:03:12,036
And they decide to escape together.

866
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:22,024
The parents of the girl warned him that he will not run.

867
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:23,730
And do not consent to leave.

868
01:03:25,506 --> 01:03:29,146
But then one day, they have a terrible fight and it is gone forever.

869
01:03:31,089 --> 01:03:34,242
Parents do not know this story ...

870
01:03:34,266 --> 01:03:36,891
But the sorely missed.

871
01:03:37,732 --> 01:03:40,541
And he suffers ... much.

872
01:03:42,613 --> 01:03:45,039
And then the worst happens.

873
01:03:46,951 --> 01:03:51,478
The man breaks your heart and the girl is gone forever.

874
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:56,025
And leaving two small children.

875
01:03:57,923 --> 01:04:01,347
And grandma, in this story,

876
01:04:01,371 --> 01:04:03,847
What do you hope happens to the girl?

877
01:04:06,477 --> 01:04:10,198
In the story is she so sad?

878
01:04:10,355 --> 01:04:14,045
Sometimes this inconsolable, but try to be happy.

879
01:04:14,069 --> 01:04:17,303
Takes medication and goes to therapy for 4 years,

880
01:04:17,327 --> 01:04:18,889
but still a little sad.

881
01:04:18,913 --> 01:04:20,453
I do not like this story.

882
01:04:20,534 --> 01:04:23,060
Grandmother what do you think the parents of this ...

883
01:04:23,084 --> 01:04:25,365
history should do, if they saw the girl again?

884
01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:32,544
Grandmother, imagine that you are in this story and the girl was your daughter.

885
01:04:32,698 --> 01:04:33,879
And he left.

886
01:04:34,216 --> 01:04:36,734
What would you say when finally come back to see?

887
01:04:40,558 --> 01:04:42,543
I would say...

888
01:04:45,943 --> 01:04:48,169
I forgive you, little girl.

889
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:10,218
I forgive you, little girl.

890
01:05:12,923 --> 01:05:14,687
That is the elixir.

891
01:05:24,787 --> 01:05:26,220
What are you doing?

892
01:05:26,656 --> 01:05:29,013
This is how children play right?

893
01:05:42,545 --> 01:05:45,065
Hey, Mom already be in the house, let's talk ...

894
01:05:45,127 --> 01:05:46,206
for it in Skype, while they walk walking behind.

895
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:47,230
According.

896
01:05:49,926 --> 01:05:51,430
It will be the outcome.

897
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:03,815
Hey guys did you see my videos? I know I look like an apple.

898
01:06:04,679 --> 01:06:06,099
The trip was great.

899
01:06:06,323 --> 01:06:08,295
Miguel and I fight this morning.

900
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:11,583
He wanted pancakes for breakfast and told him that I was gaining weight.

901
01:06:11,607 --> 01:06:13,697
Can you believe it? Things never turn me.

902
01:06:14,291 --> 01:06:15,310
- Mom? - Yes?

903
01:06:15,532 --> 01:06:16,892
Mom, come looking for us right now.

904
01:06:19,339 --> 01:06:20,582
Than? What happened?

905
01:06:20,606 --> 01:06:22,917
Mom, get in the car and go now.

906
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:25,785
You know what it take to self Rebecca?

907
01:06:25,809 --> 01:06:28,746
Mom, trust me, grandparents something strange happens.

908
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:31,150
I tell you, you must come to pick us up tonight.

909
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,974
Becca, you're scaring me, I have my heart in my throat.

910
01:06:34,876 --> 01:06:36,827
We're fine, but come now.

911
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:39,603
Where are you now?

912
01:06:39,872 --> 01:06:42,574
They are outside in the henhouse.

913
01:06:43,616 --> 01:06:45,040
They can not see you.

914
01:06:57,352 --> 01:07:00,274
- Becca? - They do strange things Mom, we've recorded.

915
01:07:00,806 --> 01:07:01,901
Becca, yo...

916
01:07:01,925 --> 01:07:05,396
Yes, I kept not tell something was Becca, right?

917
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:07,075
Becca, yo.

918
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:09,945
Grandma walks at night with a knife.

919
01:07:10,398 --> 01:07:12,430
And the grandfather had a rifle in his mouth.

920
01:07:12,465 --> 01:07:13,139
Tyler...

921
01:07:13,163 --> 01:07:14,163
I think he wanted to kill himself.

922
01:07:15,201 --> 01:07:19,112
Becca, Tyler, baby, I want you to listen carefully.

923
01:07:20,182 --> 01:07:22,496
Becca, Tyler, solo escúchenme.

924
01:07:23,762 --> 01:07:25,164
We listen.

925
01:07:27,465 --> 01:07:29,346
These are not your grandparents.

926
01:07:32,736 --> 01:07:34,127
What are you talking about Mom?

927
01:07:37,828 --> 01:07:39,337
Where are the grandparents?

928
01:07:42,118 --> 01:07:44,357
Have you been with these people all the time?

929
01:07:54,165 --> 01:07:55,925
In Masonville Police Department.

930
01:07:59,805 --> 01:08:01,115
¡Come on, come on!

931
01:08:08,116 --> 01:08:09,705
What do guys?

932
01:08:09,817 --> 01:08:11,964
Then we return cielitos.

933
01:08:13,104 --> 01:08:15,331
This is the Police Department of Masonville County.

934
01:08:15,355 --> 01:08:18,847
Our official Jerry came out, please leave a message ...

935
01:08:19,570 --> 01:08:23,181
Police did not answer, damn it, everything falls.

936
01:08:23,576 --> 01:08:27,100
Okay, I'll keep calling from the car, I promise.

937
01:08:27,424 --> 01:08:29,163
You and your brother out of there.

938
01:08:29,187 --> 01:08:30,570
Go to a neighbor's house.

939
01:08:30,594 --> 01:08:32,353
- Just calm down. - I'm coming.

940
01:08:32,377 --> 01:08:33,862
We are at home with ...

941
01:08:37,509 --> 01:08:40,777
I have a fantastic idea for when we get to pick.

942
01:08:40,801 --> 01:08:42,654
We must play a board game!

943
01:08:42,689 --> 01:08:44,506
Families play board games.

944
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:46,260
It's our last night together.

945
01:08:46,966 --> 01:08:49,949
Becca, can help me clean right?

946
01:08:50,139 --> 01:08:52,080
You can record with your camera.

947
01:08:57,202 --> 01:08:58,970
- According. - Yes.

948
01:09:23,108 --> 01:09:26,226
We could go and record some shots of the house at night.

949
01:09:27,987 --> 01:09:29,887
Okay, it sounds good sister.

950
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:33,132
Could you wipe the oven Becca?

951
01:09:49,474 --> 01:09:51,536
Metete all in.

952
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:52,902
¿Becca?

953
01:09:53,394 --> 01:09:54,913
And it has done before.

954
01:09:55,156 --> 01:09:57,329
We should shoot something out.

955
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:00,263
Do this first.

956
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:02,045
I will be quick.

957
01:10:06,997 --> 01:10:08,464
This will only take a second.

958
01:10:09,308 --> 01:10:11,740
Grandma? Grandma?

959
01:10:13,364 --> 01:10:15,626
- I clean those. - Grandmother, please open the door.

960
01:10:15,858 --> 01:10:16,858
It's okay.

961
01:10:18,276 --> 01:10:20,526
- Please open it! - It is done.

962
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:25,473
It was not for the fuss.

963
01:10:31,402 --> 01:10:33,189
Let's make it ...

964
01:10:34,465 --> 01:10:36,306
a perfect family night.

965
01:10:49,606 --> 01:10:53,050
His grandfather is very competitive with the games.

966
01:10:53,274 --> 01:10:54,556
I will warn you.

967
01:10:55,597 --> 01:10:58,537
- Can we move that here. - We will use that table.

968
01:10:59,561 --> 01:11:02,544
T. Diamond Stylus and I are going to record an interview last out ...

969
01:11:02,581 --> 01:11:03,731
and return immediately.

970
01:11:03,766 --> 01:11:04,880
We can sit there.

971
01:11:04,904 --> 01:11:06,331
Think how will the teams.

972
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,652
- Come on, come on, hurry. - I take your coat, I'm coming.

973
01:11:14,422 --> 01:11:16,187
Well, opens.

974
01:11:17,542 --> 01:11:18,882
What is that?

975
01:11:20,096 --> 01:11:23,136
And are the teams, young against old.

976
01:11:37,499 --> 01:11:41,024
Stop throwing all dice at once.

977
01:11:41,048 --> 01:11:42,867
We will lose the game because of you.

978
01:11:42,958 --> 01:11:45,182
- No, it goes. - No need to count the points.

979
01:11:45,206 --> 01:11:47,002
I am a teacher Yahtzee.

980
01:11:47,026 --> 01:11:50,524
Did not everyone in the cafeteria called the "Master Yahtzee"?

981
01:11:51,625 --> 01:11:53,022
What cafeteria?

982
01:11:53,969 --> 01:11:56,070
If you want to win in the Yahtzee, listen to me.

983
01:11:56,094 --> 01:11:58,981
You are no master of Yahtzee, that it would take 10 years.

984
01:12:04,352 --> 01:12:06,960
You see! He is using a strategy,

985
01:12:06,984 --> 01:12:09,139
approved by Milton Bradley himself.

986
01:12:09,163 --> 01:12:10,163
I do not know what I do.

987
01:12:11,065 --> 01:12:13,064
The game maker Hasbro's grandfather.

988
01:12:13,976 --> 01:12:15,089
That's a lie.

989
01:12:15,113 --> 01:12:17,236
Before the manufactured Milton Bradley.

990
01:12:17,546 --> 01:12:18,674
Becca does matter!

991
01:12:19,497 --> 01:12:20,770
Finally!

992
01:12:21,241 --> 01:12:22,627
Me I'm having so much fun!

993
01:12:28,467 --> 01:12:31,130
Me, I'm running out of battery, I now turn.

994
01:12:34,403 --> 01:12:35,556
Keep playing with them T.

995
01:12:37,002 --> 01:12:38,205
You keep playing.

996
01:12:38,858 --> 01:12:39,987
I'll be right back.

997
01:13:13,976 --> 01:13:14,976
¿Becca?

998
01:13:21,671 --> 01:13:22,998
Katy Perry.

999
01:13:27,101 --> 01:13:28,264
What time is grandma?

1000
01:13:29,201 --> 01:13:30,592
It's getting late.

1001
01:13:36,097 --> 01:13:37,983
¡Yahtzee!

1002
01:13:38,003 --> 01:13:39,208
¡Becca!

1003
01:13:43,475 --> 01:13:45,657
I'm going down to the basement.

1004
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,766
I think my grandparents are here.

1005
01:14:00,368 --> 01:14:01,607
Grandfather?

1006
01:14:02,452 --> 01:14:05,371
Grandma? Are you down here?

1007
01:14:16,135 --> 01:14:18,100
The night is not going as I wanted.

1008
01:14:27,552 --> 01:14:29,225
They spend nine.

1009
01:14:37,790 --> 01:14:40,411
I have to take your grandmother to your room, you wait here.

1010
01:14:54,184 --> 01:14:55,184
Grandma?

1011
01:14:56,321 --> 01:14:57,528
Grandfather?

1012
01:15:15,402 --> 01:15:18,052
Hospital psiquiátrico de Maple Shed.

1013
01:15:24,205 --> 01:15:27,317
What if we just play the three?

1014
01:15:43,995 --> 01:15:46,737
My name is Becca Jamison, if you find this place ...

1015
01:15:47,224 --> 01:15:48,779
My name is Mitchell.

1016
01:15:50,513 --> 01:15:53,260
They kept telling us they were fantastic.

1017
01:15:53,266 --> 01:15:55,900
They were coming to visit. They would be a family.

1018
01:15:55,978 --> 01:15:57,964
That was a bad thing to do.

1019
01:15:58,347 --> 01:16:02,905
They knew that Claire threw their children into the pond suitcases.

1020
01:16:04,204 --> 01:16:06,564
He deserved to be a grandmother, at least this week.

1021
01:16:07,569 --> 01:16:09,870
Claire's children are in Synmorfitelia.

1022
01:16:12,072 --> 01:16:13,479
And you're going to meet them.

1023
01:16:19,424 --> 01:16:20,493
Help!

1024
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:28,261
The only way to reach Synmorfitelia from here, by the well.

1025
01:16:28,285 --> 01:16:29,285
For!

1026
01:16:30,803 --> 01:16:32,675
It has not been a perfect week?

1027
01:16:33,582 --> 01:16:35,726
I promised it would be.

1028
01:16:38,212 --> 01:16:40,825
The white creature with yellow eyes is real.

1029
01:16:41,823 --> 01:16:44,376
We are waiting. I've seen on the field.

1030
01:16:46,555 --> 01:16:48,290
He laughed at us!

1031
01:16:55,294 --> 01:16:56,907

1032
01:16:56,931 --> 01:16:57,931

1033
01:16:58,014 --> 01:16:59,968
Go away fool, run!

1034
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:04,679
¡Becca!

1035
01:17:09,393 --> 01:17:11,228
We're all going to die today ... Becca.

1036
01:17:11,418 --> 01:17:12,418
No.

1037
01:17:47,064 --> 01:17:51,101
To you, I think you've been bewitched.

1038
01:18:39,755 --> 01:18:40,854
Help!

1039
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:42,447
Help!

1040
01:19:02,574 --> 01:19:04,283
Nunca me has simpatizado.

1041
01:19:09,098 --> 01:19:10,327
Claire.

1042
01:19:12,419 --> 01:19:14,245
Do you want me to tell a story?

1043
01:19:55,222 --> 01:19:58,259
I have to take the train to go to a costume party.

1044
01:19:58,478 --> 01:19:59,891
It is a company party.

1045
01:20:14,597 --> 01:20:16,298
Not today!

1046
01:20:18,225 --> 01:20:19,643
Already knew.

1047
01:20:53,421 --> 01:20:55,657
You have problems with germs, right?

1048
01:21:49,607 --> 01:21:50,607

1049
01:21:55,439 --> 01:21:56,678

1054
01:22:28,615 --> 01:22:34,787
I see the sad face ...

1055
01:22:34,811 --> 01:22:36,536
and deformed.

1056
01:22:37,132 --> 01:22:38,604
From this world.

1057
01:23:02,453 --> 01:23:04,484
We can save us all tonight.

1058

1060

1073
01:24:53,725 --> 01:24:55,431
- Mom! - OMG!

1074
01:24:56,191 --> 01:24:58,927

1075
01:25:04,915 --> 01:25:06,245
I'm already here.

1076
01:25:06,482 --> 01:25:08,188
Everybody is here?

1077
01:25:08,212 --> 01:25:09,539
I'm already here!

1078
01:25:11,964 --> 01:25:13,453
Come on, hurry.

1079
01:25:14,707 --> 01:25:18,517
The ambulance! Hurry, hurry, this way.

1080
01:25:48,453 --> 01:25:52,229
Mom, seriously, you know you do not have to.

1081
01:25:52,681 --> 01:25:54,405
I want to do this for you.

1082
01:25:59,789 --> 01:26:01,368
I liked to sing.

1083
01:26:02,650 --> 01:26:05,114
My mother said she was not listening.

1084
01:26:05,137 --> 01:26:08,983
But, I was behind the input clock.

1085
01:26:09,007 --> 01:26:10,967
With a kitchen towel, covering her mouth,

1086
01:26:11,002 --> 01:26:12,022
to hide his smile.

1087
01:26:13,349 --> 01:26:15,971
I thought he sang better than Olivia Newton John.

1088
01:26:15,995 --> 01:26:19,384
Olivia Newton John, era como su Elvis.

1089
01:26:20,782 --> 01:26:22,497
My father was a gentleman.

1090
01:26:24,125 --> 01:26:26,460
We used to walk together and just talked.

1091
01:26:27,156 --> 01:26:29,603
As a child, I woke up early,

1092
01:26:29,704 --> 01:26:31,422
working on a project.

1093
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:35,600
My father believed he was destined for great things.

1094
01:26:38,296 --> 01:26:40,997
Well, it was before that day.

1095
01:26:44,287 --> 01:26:46,456
The day I left, it was horrible.

1096
01:26:47,665 --> 01:26:49,587
My parents insulted me.

1097
01:26:52,170 --> 01:26:56,210
I went to the door and my mother, I stood in front.

1098
01:26:57,245 --> 01:26:58,245
I hit my mother.

1099
01:27:00,432 --> 01:27:02,126
And then my dad hit me.

1100
01:27:03,019 --> 01:27:07,117
3 And we were paralyzed and then I left.

1101
01:27:09,483 --> 01:27:12,157
They tried to contact me soon after,

1102
01:27:12,347 --> 01:27:14,678
but never answer your calls.

1103
01:27:19,773 --> 01:27:21,689
I know that I forgive querías Becca.

1104
01:27:24,963 --> 01:27:26,436
But there was no need affection.

1105
01:27:29,379 --> 01:27:31,049
I was there when he wanted to.

1106
