Bad Batch 5035 to 5040,

5
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:13,848
step into the room.

USRCS employees are advised to limit

8
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:22,648
once you are tagged,
go to the left side of the room

9
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:24,692
and get your rations.
Single-file line, please.

10
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,069
USRCS employees are never to inquire

11
00:00:27,153 --> 00:00:28,446
- details regarding fittings.
- Come on, folks.

12
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,613
Let's keep 'em moving.

13
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:34,744
Bad Batch Inmate 5040, Arlen Mae Johnson?

14
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:39,165
Take a seat right there, miss.
I need your right ear, please.

15
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:41,250
USRCS employees are reminded

16
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,503
to clearly differentiate
between personal view statements

17
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:49,300
and views, statements, positions made
on behalf of the agency or association.

18
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:52,595
Bad Batch 5039, you can move out.

19
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:57,141
USRCS employees are advised
to avoid prolonged physical contact

20
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,392
with Bad Batch inmates.

21
00:00:58,726 --> 00:00:59,894
All right 5040, you can move out.

22
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:04,231
Step through.

23
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:07,485
Stand back from the gate.

24
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,203
You wanna radio it in?

25
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:19,705
It's hotter than the devil's a-hole out here.

26
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:22,541
Whoo! Get me back to that AC.

27
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:49,027
Help me! Help me!

28
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,769
No.

29
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:43,273
No. No!

30
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:41,201
Help, somebody!

31
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,869
Hey!

32
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:45,789
Help! I just want to go home!

33
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,041
Please, somebody!

34
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,418
Oh, my God! Please!

35
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,373
Huh? Goddamn.

36
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:10,702
Come on.

37
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,162
Be right there.

38
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,413
Okay, come on in.

39
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:15,707
Is it ready?

40
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:57,387
Tore her ass up.

41
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,141
Homegirl got fucked up!

42
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:02,934
Fuck, homes.

43
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,687
She stink, man.

44
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:09,149
Right.

45
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:11,234
I'm surprised she's alive, homes.

46
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,038
I can't find my fuckin' shoes.

47
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:24,998
Where are my shoes?

48
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,374
Hey, y'all seen my shoes?

49
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:29,669
It's all rusted out.
Doesn't even fuckin' work.

50
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,881
If you forget everything else but not this,

51
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,426
you have nothing to worry about.

52
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,304
It's the one thing...

53
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,015
Keep walkin', motherfucker. Keep walkin'.

54
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,642
There's one thing you must never forget.

55
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,477
Never forget.

56
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,730
Never, never, never,
never, never, never, never,

57
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,524
never, never forget this one thing.

58
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:57,655
If you remember everything else,
if you forget this one thing...

59
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:58,907
Whoo!

60
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:03,077
If you remember everything else
and you forget this one thing,

61
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:05,663
you will... you will have
done nothing in your life!

62
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,749
Nothing! Nothing!

63
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:13,213
This is the one thing, the one thing
you must never forget!

64
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,506
Give me some fucking noodles!

65
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,591
One dollar!

66
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:17,592
- Demon!
- One dollar!

67
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,385
She's a goddamn... she's a goddamn demon!

68
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:20,678
You no pay, no noodle!

69
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,555
No noodle for you, no pay!

70
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,265
Thank you very much. Huh?

71
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:29,062
- Hey, what's the thing?
- Shut up, motherfucker!

72
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,149
The thing?

73
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,484
The thing.

74
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:39,906
How should I know?

75
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,034
Find out for yourself.

76
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,870
You find out for yourself.

77
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:47,956
No one is gonna tell you.

78
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,500
You have to figure it out for yourself.

79
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,585
You have to figure it out.

80
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,256
Forget everything else but this one thing.

81
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:57,674
You have nothing to worry about.

82
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:59,759
Just one thing.

83
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,011
Must never forget.

84
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:16,850
All right, get up! Get up!

85
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:03,477
I can't do it again.

86
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,255
I can't do it again.

87
00:24:07,438 --> 00:24:10,307
Please don't do this! Please!

88
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:13,835
Please! Please, I'm begging you!
Please don't do this!

89
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,165
I can't do this again! I can't do it!

90
00:24:18,598 --> 00:24:21,335
Please don't do this! I can't do it again!

91
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:24,172
I can't do it. Please. Oh, God, please.

92
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:27,758
Please don't make me!
Please just let me go! Please!

93
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:30,219
I don't want any... please don't do this!

94
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:32,513
Please, please, please, I'm begging you!

95
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:34,348
I'm begging you! Please don't do this!

96
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:37,435
Oh, God! No, please! Please!

97
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:39,395
Please, I can't! No, no, no.

98
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,108
So sick of this shit.

99
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,194
Sick and tired of this shit.

100
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,567
There. Push, push.

101
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:07,927
Where do y'all come from?

102
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:15,684
You come from Comfort?

103
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,524
Look, I ain't got no problem.

104
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:25,319
No problem with you.

105
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:35,037
You're a Bridge person.

106
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:42,753
We're just out here
looking for plates, that's all.

107
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,716
That's right.

108
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:49,885
Looking for plates.

109
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,560
Honey, stay back.

110
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,529
Does your kid eat people, too?

111
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:14,952
I'm just trying to live out here,
same as you.

112
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:18,080
Ain't easy for me neither.

113
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:37,474
Look, we the same, we are.

114
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:39,893
No, we ain't.

115
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:41,770
We ain't the same.

116
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,357
We both Bad Batch, right?

117
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:47,192
We ain't the fuckin' same!

118
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:48,360
Do you hear me?

119
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,163
Please.

120
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,623
Just let us go.

121
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:03,959
Yeah, I did that.

122
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:06,295
Begged.

123
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:07,921
Pleaded.

124
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,507
Just like you're doing.

125
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:17,765
Tell me what you want.

126
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:19,099
I'll do it.

127
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:25,439
So, tell me what you want me to do

128
00:34:25,522 --> 00:34:27,149
- and I'll do it.
- Shut up.

129
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:33,864
Just tell me what you want...

130
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,657
There's fuckin' nothing you can do.

131
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:55,125
You kind of stink, kid.

132
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,336
You want me to take your socks off?

133
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:09,514
My name's Arlen.

134
00:39:10,557 --> 00:39:11,850
What's your name?

135
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,150
Look, no one cares about you now.

136
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:25,947
I could have just left you
out there in the desert.

137
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:29,785
Is that where you wanna be?

138
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:31,495
Hmm?

139
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,085
Now, you like this bunny, don't you?

140
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,382
Do you wanna keep him?

141
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:55,352
Then, you got to do exactly what I say.

142
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:22,355
That dead woman over there.

143
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,566
There was... a kid was with her.

144
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:27,152
Did you see this kid?

145
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:30,238
Did you see her?

146
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,160
Did you see her?

147
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:40,248
You better start talking, old man.

148
00:41:45,712 --> 00:41:46,880
Did you see her?

149
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:52,469
What you want?

150
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:48,269
Keep it steady.

151
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:51,523
Nice straight line.

152
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:55,694
Let me see.

153
00:44:58,279 --> 00:44:59,489
That's good.

154
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:04,077
A little bit more down here.

155
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:23,948
Yeah, baby.

156
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:36,137
Come on, baby! Do that move!

157
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:38,671
Move it down.

158
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:45,970
Dang, baby!

159
00:46:46,763 --> 00:46:50,141
People of Comfort, good evening!

160
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,605
Give us The Dream!

161
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:58,441
Give us The Dream!

162
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:00,985
Give us The Dream!

163
00:47:01,778 --> 00:47:03,822
Give us The Dream!

164
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,574
Give us The Dream!

165
00:47:07,075 --> 00:47:10,829
Make some noise for the one and only!

166
00:47:11,621 --> 00:47:18,461
The Dream!

167
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:31,724
Come on, Dream! Change my life!

168
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:36,020
He looked at me! He looked at me!

169
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:37,856
- We love you!
- I love you, too.

170
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:42,527
Heal my life with The Dream!

171
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:47,574
I've been wanting to dream all my life!

172
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:51,327
Come on now, Dream!

173
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:58,459
I love you, Dream!

174
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:05,425
I've got a question.

175
00:48:07,844 --> 00:48:08,928
Why are we out here?

176
00:48:09,012 --> 00:48:12,515
Just what are we doing in the middle
of the goddamn desert tonight?

177
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:15,685
Jimmy! Jimmy!

178
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,354
That's right. That's right.

179
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:20,398
You want that music only Jimmy can make.

180
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:28,698
Let me tell you something about Jimmy.

181
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,076
You know why Jimmy's here?

182
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,828
- Why?
- Jimmy!

183
00:48:33,912 --> 00:48:36,915
- Why?
- He's Bad Batch.

184
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:38,374
Yeah, yeah!

185
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:40,168
Bad Batch, fucker!

186
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:43,129
Nonfunctioning member of society.

187
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:45,048
That's what they told him.

188
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:47,342
That's right.

189
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:52,180
All of us here, we weren't good enough.

190
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:53,973
Smart enough.

191
00:48:54,057 --> 00:48:55,600
- Yeah!
- Young enough.

192
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:57,477
- Healthy enough.
- You're right!

193
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,853
Wealthy enough.

194
00:48:59,354 --> 00:49:01,230
Sane enough.

195
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:04,400
Freaks.

196
00:49:05,944 --> 00:49:07,695
Parasites.

197
00:49:07,946 --> 00:49:10,490
Bad Batch! Motherfucking Bad Batch!

198
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:12,575
This here is the Bad Batch.

199
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:15,244
Bad Batch, bitches!

200
00:49:15,328 --> 00:49:17,956
We ain't good. We're bad.

201
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:20,708
Yeah, yeah, that's right, Bad Batch!

202
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:22,835
Yeah, Bad Batch.

203
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:26,673
That's right.

204
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:29,300
We're bad, baby!

205
00:49:30,093 --> 00:49:34,806
Now, there's only one rule
here, and it's this.

206
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:38,309
It's time to wake up.

207
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:41,771
It's time to find... The Dream.

208
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:42,939
The Dream!

209
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:51,614
All glory to The Dream!

210
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:59,372
We're a Bad Batch, motherfuckers!

211
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:01,582
Bad Batch, motherfuckers!

212
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:26,000
Yeah!

213
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,879
Yee-haw!

214
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:36,427
- Yeah.
- What's wrong with that?

215
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:45,853
Is this your rabbit?

216
00:52:45,663 --> 00:52:46,622
Where is she?

217
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:48,666
She was just right here?

218
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:50,084
That kid.

219
00:52:50,543 --> 00:52:52,461
She was right here a second ago.

220
00:52:52,879 --> 00:52:54,714
She was right here a second ago.

221
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:56,382
She's got to be here somewhere.

222
00:52:56,465 --> 00:52:58,176
Where did that kid go?

223
00:52:58,259 --> 00:52:59,719
I lost her.

224
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:01,846
That kid. I hope she's okay.

225
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:03,598
What did I do? She's got to be here.

226
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:05,183
I know she's got to be here.

227
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:07,643
She's got to be here somewhere.

228
00:53:09,145 --> 00:53:11,689
What did I do? What did I do?

229
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:15,067
Where did that kid go?

230
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:22,992
Hey, you guys seen a little girl?

231
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:31,959
Hey, you seen a kid?

232
00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:39,050
What am I gonna do now?

233
00:53:44,055 --> 00:53:47,016
I hate this place.

234
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:49,852
What is this place?

235
00:53:49,936 --> 00:53:51,896
This place.

236
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:54,607
What is this place?

237
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:56,651
What is this place?

238
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:06,911
Here's what you do.

239
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:09,247
Okay, here's what you do.

240
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:12,041
Go somewhere. Go far away.

241
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:13,876
You go far away.

242
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,086
Somewhere. Leave Comfort.

243
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:16,796
Leave Comfort.

244
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:19,131
Just go for a walk.

245
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:22,677
Just go for a walk.

246
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,140
Somewhere. Anywhere.

247
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:05,136
Wow.

248
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:08,723
It's so big.

249
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:10,308
Wow.

250
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:13,602
So big.

251
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:18,357
Wow.

252
00:55:18,441 --> 00:55:19,984
It's so big.

253
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:22,069
Wow! It's so big.

254
00:55:22,153 --> 00:55:26,157
It's pretty, so pretty.

255
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:31,579
Is that what it always looks like?

256
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:35,374
Doesn't always look like that.

257
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:03,110
Wow.

258
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:39,373
Thought it was pretty at first, but...

259
00:57:41,459 --> 00:57:44,044
now, I'm not so sure.

260
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:52,303
I don't even really know what it is.

261
00:57:59,185 --> 00:58:01,270
Do you?

262
00:58:36,889 --> 00:58:38,390
You're big.

263
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:47,483
Strange, isn't it?

264
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:50,736
Here we are

265
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:54,573
in the darkest corner of this Earth,

266
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:58,786
and we're afraid of our own kind.

267
00:59:55,968 --> 00:59:57,511
Hmm.

268
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,628
You know where you are?

269
01:00:46,268 --> 01:00:48,687
You are a long way from Comfort.

270
01:00:49,104 --> 01:00:53,067
And without this, you go nowhere.

271
01:01:23,222 --> 01:01:25,057
Did you see a kid look like that?

272
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:34,525
Did you see her?

273
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,819
No.

274
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:51,250
I'm going to take you to Comfort,
and you will go inside

275
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:53,001
and find her for me.

276
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:18,318
Listen to me good.

277
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:24,825
I don't care about nothing or nobody

278
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:26,952
except that little girl.

279
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:34,334
And I'm going to kill you
if you don't find her for me.

280
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:37,713
Comprende?

281
01:02:42,968 --> 01:02:44,261
Mm.

282
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:49,326
Vámonos!

283
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:50,828
I'm thirsty.

284
01:03:51,787 --> 01:03:54,331
This make you more thirsty.

285
01:03:57,292 --> 01:03:58,752
We got guns at the wall.

286
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:00,838
They'll shoot if they see you.

287
01:04:02,381 --> 01:04:03,757
Mm.

288
01:04:08,387 --> 01:04:09,555
So what?

289
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:11,390
That's your kid?

290
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:15,811
What if I can't find her?

291
01:04:18,856 --> 01:04:20,858
You will find her.

292
01:05:38,226 --> 01:05:40,187
Trade you for that leg.

293
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:23,522
I'm being friendly, dude.

294
01:06:24,523 --> 01:06:26,316
I can just keep it all for myself.

295
01:06:26,692 --> 01:06:27,985
It's up to you.

296
01:07:05,022 --> 01:07:06,398
Wait!

297
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:07,733
No!

298
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:16,700
Mm!

299
01:07:18,577 --> 01:07:20,579
Fuck.

300
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:22,581
Mm-hmm.

301
01:07:25,917 --> 01:07:27,127
No.

302
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:29,379
No, no, no, no! No!

303
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:46,146
Let me go!

304
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:48,982
Aah!

305
01:09:09,146 --> 01:09:10,564
Vámonos!

306
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,400
Would you turn around, please?

307
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:41,464
What's your deal?

308
01:11:42,257 --> 01:11:44,009
How come you're in the Bad Batch?

309
01:11:49,556 --> 01:11:50,974
Gang related?

310
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:57,689
Drug related?

311
01:12:03,111 --> 01:12:04,696
Illegal.

312
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,157
No papers.

313
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:12,162
You a Mexican?

314
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:17,125
Cubano, from Havana.

315
01:12:23,548 --> 01:12:25,467
I heard of Cuba.

316
01:12:26,301 --> 01:12:28,178
That's in the tropics, right?

317
01:12:29,304 --> 01:12:30,597
Near Hawaii?

318
01:13:06,091 --> 01:13:07,801
Here is Cuba.

319
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:11,096
I am born here, in Havana.

320
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:14,766
I come with a boat to America when I'm 16.

321
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:17,185
To Miami.

322
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:18,520
Miami.

323
01:13:18,937 --> 01:13:20,271
What did you do there?

324
01:13:20,688 --> 01:13:22,816
Like, what did you do in Miami?

325
01:13:25,235 --> 01:13:26,736
A lot of thing.

326
01:13:27,445 --> 01:13:30,782
I make tattoos, construction.

327
01:13:30,865 --> 01:13:31,991
I do this, that.

328
01:13:32,075 --> 01:13:33,326
No big deal.

329
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:37,622
I got this one when I was 13.

330
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:40,500
And this.

331
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:54,013
See this one?

332
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:58,059
It's from the first boy I ever loved.

333
01:13:58,435 --> 01:14:00,186
He was a musician.

334
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:03,356
We both got matching ones at the same time.

335
01:14:07,735 --> 01:14:10,780
And this one, 5040.

336
01:14:13,992 --> 01:14:15,326
What's your number?

337
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:22,375
Come on.

338
01:14:23,168 --> 01:14:24,335
What's your number?

339
01:14:32,177 --> 01:14:33,595
What's the big deal?

340
01:14:35,889 --> 01:14:37,807
Just show me your number.

341
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:12,342
Your kind, you're evil.

342
01:15:13,885 --> 01:15:15,178
That's what you are.

343
01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:16,513
Evil.

344
01:15:20,308 --> 01:15:22,227
You don't see things how they are.

345
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:25,396
You only see things how you are.

346
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:26,773
I don't care.

347
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:28,942
I hate you.

348
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:30,527
Get it?

349
01:15:33,488 --> 01:15:35,198
I hate all of y'all.

350
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:42,288
No problema para mí.

351
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:44,249
It's okay.

352
01:15:56,594 --> 01:15:58,680
Doesn't change nothing for me.

353
01:16:00,098 --> 01:16:02,475
Doesn't change nothing for you.

354
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:20,285
Ohh.

355
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:28,459
Ohh!

356
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:45,184
Come on. Come with me.

357
01:16:45,268 --> 01:16:46,728
Come on.

358
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:01,034
Let's go, man.
I'm getting the fuck out of here.

359
01:17:07,624 --> 01:17:09,626
Come on. Hurry the fuck up.

360
01:17:14,964 --> 01:17:16,424
Let's go now.

361
01:17:31,064 --> 01:17:32,398
Open up.

362
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:37,487
Close it up.

363
01:17:40,365 --> 01:17:42,575
- What's up, man?
- Hey, what's going on?

364
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:43,660
What's your number, fool?

365
01:17:43,743 --> 01:17:45,244
5828.

366
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:47,038
Been out in the desert two days, man.

367
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:48,206
I need some food.

368
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:49,957
Are you guys gonna help me out or what?

369
01:17:50,041 --> 01:17:51,542
What's up with the white girl, man?

370
01:17:51,626 --> 01:17:54,170
Found her ass out there
with one of them Bridge people.

371
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:55,380
All right, kick back, homey.

372
01:17:55,463 --> 01:17:57,006
- Thanks, man.
- Welcome to Comfort ese.

373
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:58,383
Yeah, welcome to Comfort.

374
01:25:46,976 --> 01:25:48,561
Excuse me.

375
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:49,937
Have you seen this kid?

376
01:25:51,272 --> 01:25:52,314
No.

377
01:25:52,398 --> 01:25:54,066
You seen this kid?

378
01:25:54,608 --> 01:25:55,860
No.

379
01:25:55,943 --> 01:25:57,736
Excuse me, sir.

380
01:25:58,195 --> 01:25:59,780
Have you seen this kid anywhere?

381
01:25:59,864 --> 01:26:00,781
Uh-uh.

382
01:26:00,865 --> 01:26:02,408
No?

383
01:26:02,950 --> 01:26:05,619
Can you look out for her, please?

384
01:26:12,168 --> 01:26:13,210
Oh, he ain't ever gonna be wasted.

385
01:26:13,294 --> 01:26:15,254
Hey, have you guys seen a little girl?

386
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:18,132
I ain't seen shit, man.

387
01:26:25,347 --> 01:26:27,516
I wish they'd stop making pennies.

388
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:30,186
I hate pennies.

389
01:26:30,269 --> 01:26:31,353
I hate 'em!

390
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:32,563
Hey!

391
01:26:32,646 --> 01:26:34,648
- I keep losing things.
- Hey.

392
01:26:34,732 --> 01:26:36,817
Don't wanna be a loser. I wanna be a finder.

393
01:26:36,901 --> 01:26:39,069
Finder finds things. Loser loses them.

394
01:26:39,486 --> 01:26:41,280
Yeah. I need to find a kid.

395
01:26:41,363 --> 01:26:42,531
A little girl.

396
01:26:42,781 --> 01:26:44,033
Yeah.

397
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:46,243
- She's about this tall.
- Yeah.

398
01:26:46,327 --> 01:26:47,661
- You've seen her?
- Yeah.

399
01:26:47,745 --> 01:26:50,331
- Where?
- Hey, you wanna play with my puzzle?

400
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:53,959
You wanna play?

401
01:26:55,211 --> 01:26:57,379
No, I'm not gonna play with your puzzle.

402
01:26:57,463 --> 01:26:59,506
- Thank you.
- I'll call you later.

403
01:32:07,523 --> 01:32:09,441
Yeah, baby!

404
01:32:10,776 --> 01:32:12,402
Woo!

405
01:32:15,989 --> 01:32:18,116
It's happening!

406
01:32:36,718 --> 01:32:38,512
Yeah.

407
01:32:38,595 --> 01:32:39,846
Yeah, baby.

408
01:33:29,563 --> 01:33:31,273
Take a good look there.

409
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:40,866
That's the economy of Comfort
sitting right in front of you.

410
01:33:43,493 --> 01:33:45,329
Right beautiful.

411
01:33:48,832 --> 01:33:51,793
See, you can catch more flies with honey.

412
01:33:53,629 --> 01:33:55,797
But who wants flies?

413
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:03,680
Remind me your name again,

414
01:34:03,764 --> 01:34:05,140
Sweetheart.

415
01:34:06,141 --> 01:34:07,684
It's Arlen.

416
01:34:10,145 --> 01:34:12,272
Let me ask you a question, Arlen.

417
01:34:12,773 --> 01:34:16,568
When you shit here in Comfort,
your shit goes away.

418
01:34:16,652 --> 01:34:18,153
That accurate?

419
01:34:18,236 --> 01:34:19,655
I guess.

420
01:34:19,738 --> 01:34:21,156
You shit.

421
01:34:21,239 --> 01:34:23,075
It leaves.

422
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:25,452
You know why it leaves?

423
01:34:27,704 --> 01:34:29,164
Um...

424
01:34:30,832 --> 01:34:34,753
because the toilet takes it someplace?

425
01:34:35,796 --> 01:34:37,464
Yes, it does.

426
01:34:39,424 --> 01:34:41,301
Takes it where it takes it...

427
01:34:43,053 --> 01:34:44,805
because of me.

428
01:34:49,017 --> 01:34:51,311
'Cause I hate the idea

429
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:53,855
that my sons and daughters

430
01:34:53,939 --> 01:34:56,566
would have to stew in their own shit.

431
01:35:00,529 --> 01:35:02,656
Cows stand in their shit.

432
01:35:04,908 --> 01:35:06,827
They stand in their shit...

433
01:35:07,953 --> 01:35:09,996
'cause they're cows.

434
01:35:10,372 --> 01:35:12,457
Pigs stand in their shit...

435
01:35:13,166 --> 01:35:15,043
'cause they're pigs.

436
01:35:18,046 --> 01:35:22,968
Some misbehaving humans been making
hamburgers out of my sons and daughters.

437
01:35:24,094 --> 01:35:26,012
We are not cows.

438
01:35:27,139 --> 01:35:29,391
We don't stand in our shit.

439
01:35:30,809 --> 01:35:32,352
Reason we don't...

440
01:35:33,437 --> 01:35:35,814
is because I won't let that happen.

441
01:35:37,274 --> 01:35:39,151
I got each and every toilet in Comfort

442
01:35:39,234 --> 01:35:42,362
taking that shit from all your little asses

443
01:35:43,029 --> 01:35:45,699
and sending it down the pipes
till it reaches a place

444
01:35:45,782 --> 01:35:50,245
where no one thinks about it
and no one smells it.

445
01:35:51,288 --> 01:35:52,998
Ain't that nice of me?

446
01:36:07,512 --> 01:36:08,972
But you don't like it here,

447
01:36:10,056 --> 01:36:11,641
do you?

448
01:36:16,605 --> 01:36:18,064
No, I just...

449
01:36:20,984 --> 01:36:23,320
Costs a lot to be here.

450
01:36:24,905 --> 01:36:27,157
Cost you an arm and a leg.

451
01:36:30,243 --> 01:36:32,370
Where would you rather be?

452
01:36:47,135 --> 01:36:48,512
It's all right.

453
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:06,530
You know what I see when I look at you?

454
01:37:08,073 --> 01:37:10,700
A sailboat out in the sea...

455
01:37:12,619 --> 01:37:14,454
with no wind.

456
01:37:19,751 --> 01:37:22,337
What is it you want, Arlen?

457
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:25,757
If you could have one thing,

458
01:37:26,174 --> 01:37:27,425
anything,

459
01:37:28,510 --> 01:37:30,011
what would it be?

460
01:37:31,096 --> 01:37:33,849
- Anything?
- Anything at all.

461
01:37:39,062 --> 01:37:40,647
A time machine.

462
01:37:43,066 --> 01:37:44,442
Why?

463
01:37:45,777 --> 01:37:47,279
So I could go back.

464
01:37:47,654 --> 01:37:49,739
Fix things.

465
01:37:50,949 --> 01:37:52,367
Make it better.

466
01:37:55,287 --> 01:37:57,414
All the things you've done

467
01:37:58,540 --> 01:38:00,333
have put you right here,

468
01:38:01,167 --> 01:38:02,669
on this couch,

469
01:38:02,919 --> 01:38:06,506
in this room, with me.

470
01:38:12,470 --> 01:38:13,930
Close your eyes.

471
01:38:17,684 --> 01:38:19,185
Close them.

472
01:38:28,737 --> 01:38:31,323
What do you really want?

473
01:38:37,412 --> 01:38:40,248
I wanna be the solution for something.

474
01:38:50,175 --> 01:38:52,010
You know what this is?

475
01:38:52,844 --> 01:38:54,429
It's a tomato.

476
01:38:57,182 --> 01:38:58,600
First,

477
01:39:00,518 --> 01:39:02,270
it was a seed.

478
01:39:04,105 --> 01:39:06,107
You take care of a garden,

479
01:39:06,733 --> 01:39:09,027
and it takes care of you back.

480
01:39:09,444 --> 01:39:10,987
You feed it,

481
01:39:11,529 --> 01:39:13,490
it feeds you.

482
01:39:13,865 --> 01:39:16,910
Few things in this world operate like that,

483
01:39:17,243 --> 01:39:18,954
fair and square.

484
01:39:21,998 --> 01:39:24,334
It just needs a place to grow.

485
01:39:29,965 --> 01:39:33,551
It grows and grows.

486
01:39:35,345 --> 01:39:37,097
Then it comes out

487
01:39:37,847 --> 01:39:39,808
and it's part of the world.

488
01:39:41,142 --> 01:39:43,687
Because you know what The Dream really is?

489
01:39:46,314 --> 01:39:47,607
It's life.

490
01:39:48,024 --> 01:39:49,734
Life is The Dream.

491
01:39:51,277 --> 01:39:53,196
The only dream.

492
01:40:08,461 --> 01:40:10,213
I want The Dream.

493
01:40:10,922 --> 01:40:12,674
What dream is that?

494
01:40:13,341 --> 01:40:14,926
This one here.

495
01:40:16,594 --> 01:40:18,388
Like they have.

496
01:40:33,486 --> 01:40:35,780
Make up a room for our guest.

497
01:42:06,287 --> 01:42:08,123
Is everything okay?

498
01:42:27,392 --> 01:42:30,436
Hey. I'm sorry.

499
01:42:32,355 --> 01:42:34,440
I guess I'm just a bit nervous.

500
01:42:34,524 --> 01:42:36,025
That's okay.

501
01:42:36,401 --> 01:42:37,819
Can you come in for a second?

502
01:42:39,028 --> 01:42:41,114
Yeah, of course.

503
01:43:04,304 --> 01:43:06,598
Is this really necessary?

504
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:15,773
Come here, kid.

505
01:43:16,983 --> 01:43:18,234
We're going.

506
01:43:21,196 --> 01:43:22,655
Bring her down!

507
01:43:23,323 --> 01:43:25,825
You wanna see it all over your fucking walls?

508
01:43:54,646 --> 01:43:55,897
Come here.

509
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:01,819
Promise me something.

510
01:44:03,529 --> 01:44:05,615
Take care of this rabbit.

511
01:44:06,366 --> 01:44:08,284
Come on.

512
01:44:09,994 --> 01:44:11,621
Yeah.

513
01:44:12,622 --> 01:44:15,416
When we're out and clear
of the wall, I'll let her go.

514
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,335
Come here.

515
01:44:17,877 --> 01:44:19,504
Let's go, kid.

516
01:44:20,338 --> 01:44:22,882
I'm real disappointed in you, Arlen.

517
01:44:24,717 --> 01:44:26,636
Real disappointed.

518
01:44:36,896 --> 01:44:38,356
Once we're out, I'll let her go.

519
01:44:38,439 --> 01:44:39,732
I swear.

520
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:55,123
Yo, check this shit out right here, homes.

521
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:57,458
- Open it, Nacho.
- Open the gate, homes.

522
01:44:57,542 --> 01:44:58,751
Open it!

523
01:45:02,088 --> 01:45:03,172
Come on.

524
01:45:06,884 --> 01:45:08,261
Bye, guerita.

525
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:12,181
Don't come back, you crazy bitch.

526
01:45:33,202 --> 01:45:34,962
Get in the front.

527
01:45:40,501 --> 01:45:41,836
Come on.

528
01:47:19,058 --> 01:47:20,351
Miel.

529
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:50,548
You good? Okay?

530
01:48:39,722 --> 01:48:40,806
Hey.

531
01:48:43,142 --> 01:48:44,560
Wait.

532
01:48:48,064 --> 01:48:49,607
What are you doing right now?

533
01:48:53,402 --> 01:48:55,238
Do you wanna hang out or something?

534
01:48:58,533 --> 01:49:00,576
You are very confused, no?

535
01:49:04,497 --> 01:49:06,165
Not really.

536
01:49:07,542 --> 01:49:09,418
What you think I am, gringa?

537
01:49:13,798 --> 01:49:17,677
What if all these things that happened
to us happened to us so the next things

538
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:21,097
that gonna happen to us can happen to us?

539
01:49:26,936 --> 01:49:28,771
You brought back my kid.

540
01:49:30,898 --> 01:49:32,275
You done now.

541
01:49:32,525 --> 01:49:34,277
You can go.

542
01:49:35,278 --> 01:49:36,904
Go back to Comfort.

543
01:49:37,238 --> 01:49:39,115
I'm not going back there.

544
01:49:41,158 --> 01:49:44,203
In this place is only death for you.

545
01:49:44,287 --> 01:49:45,955
Is like that.

546
01:49:49,166 --> 01:49:50,835
Well, I like it here.

547
01:49:53,671 --> 01:49:55,006
What do you like?

548
01:49:56,215 --> 01:49:57,466
Where is here?

549
01:50:00,428 --> 01:50:01,512
Look around.

550
01:50:01,971 --> 01:50:03,764
Is nothing.

551
01:50:32,001 --> 01:50:36,297
I want spaghetti because
the other man gave me spaghetti.

552
01:50:54,106 --> 01:50:56,150
I want spaghetti.

553
01:50:56,525 --> 01:50:59,236
I'm hungry. I want spaghetti!

554
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:01,280
I want spaghetti!
