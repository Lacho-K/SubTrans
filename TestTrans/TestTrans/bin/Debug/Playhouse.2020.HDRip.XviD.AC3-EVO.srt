2
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:44,241
Shh.

3
00:03:44,275 --> 00:03:46,010
Shh, hey, it's okay.

4
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:49,213
Shh.

5
00:03:49,246 --> 00:03:52,249
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay, shh,
shh, shh.

6
00:03:52,283 --> 00:03:54,118
It's just a nightmare.

7
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:55,152
Hey, hey.

8
00:04:05,896 --> 00:04:07,198
Wanna tell me about it?

9
00:04:07,231 --> 00:04:10,067
Oh, I knew you'd ask me that.

10
00:04:12,636 --> 00:04:15,206
Oh, just go, you stink of
cigars.

11
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,208
Sometimes it's best to talk
about it.

12
00:04:19,877 --> 00:04:21,679
You're weird.

13
00:04:23,114 --> 00:04:25,549
Am I?

14
00:04:43,134 --> 00:04:44,135
You sleep okay?

15
00:05:34,718 --> 00:05:36,720
Sleepover.

16
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:37,755
Or is it tomorrow?

17
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,691
It's too thick, isn't it?

18
00:05:41,826 --> 00:05:43,194
They don't even like me.

19
00:05:43,227 --> 00:05:46,864
You mean you don't even like
them?

20
00:05:46,897 --> 00:05:47,998
What's not to like?

21
00:05:48,032 --> 00:05:50,067
They've only known you two
months.

22
00:05:50,101 --> 00:05:52,036
You're the new girl on the
block.

23
00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:53,170
On the block?

24
00:05:53,204 --> 00:05:54,271
Queen of the Scottish castle.

25
00:05:54,305 --> 00:05:57,908
Oh, don't say that, I hate
it when people say that.

26
00:06:04,682 --> 00:06:07,017
Where are all your friends,
anyway?

27
00:06:07,051 --> 00:06:08,752
Why is it just me who
has to make an effort?

28
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:10,254
One, I do make an effort.

29
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,723
And two, you're the one
finishing school today.

30
00:06:12,756 --> 00:06:14,325
I don't want you moping
about in your room all day

31
00:06:14,358 --> 00:06:15,527
not seeing anyone.

32
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,028
You seem to have made a
pretty good career out of that.

33
00:06:18,062 --> 00:06:20,197
Yes, but I get paid for it.

34
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:23,435
You could pay me.

35
00:06:23,468 --> 00:06:27,405
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

36
00:06:31,108 --> 00:06:34,311
It was the perfect blend!

37
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:48,792
Bee, wait.

38
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:49,860
- I'm late, Dad.
- Wait,

39
00:06:49,894 --> 00:06:51,162
I wanna show you something.

40
00:06:52,897 --> 00:06:53,864
Close your eyes.

41
00:06:53,898 --> 00:06:55,467
- What?
- Please.

42
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,700
No tricks.

43
00:07:00,371 --> 00:07:03,240
Ladies and gentlemen, behind
these boards

44
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:05,276
is the seed of what lies ahead,

45
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:06,277
a vision of what is yet to be.

46
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,778
Do not be afraid.

47
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:08,647
It may appear as magic,

48
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,848
but I can assure you, it's only
theatre.

49
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:13,050
The makeover.

50
00:07:14,486 --> 00:07:17,087
Which is your favourite, two or
six?

51
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:19,023
Oh, I shouldn't have said that.

52
00:07:19,056 --> 00:07:20,991
I prefer it as it is.

53
00:07:22,427 --> 00:07:23,260
You're absolutely right,

54
00:07:23,294 --> 00:07:24,762
- it's more...
- Ugly.

55
00:07:24,795 --> 00:07:26,263
Yes.

56
00:07:28,098 --> 00:07:31,101
Bee, can you at least show
some excitement about all this?

57
00:07:31,135 --> 00:07:34,038
Forget the paint, I mean the
whole thing.

58
00:07:34,071 --> 00:07:35,739
This place, our new life.

59
00:07:35,773 --> 00:07:38,209
I didn't want a new life.

60
00:07:38,242 --> 00:07:40,010
I'm trying to make things
better for us.

61
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:42,813
There's something here, I can
feel it.

62
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:45,216
I'm alive, I'm alive!

63
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:48,085
- The "Living Play."
- The "Living Play," Bee.

64
00:07:48,118 --> 00:07:50,821
- A play that has to be...
- Has to be experienced,

65
00:07:50,854 --> 00:07:52,856
not merely seen.

66
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,893
Hundreds of people exploring
multiple rooms all at once.

67
00:07:55,926 --> 00:07:56,894
Yes.

68
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:00,864
Props, costumes, sound
design, special effects.

69
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:02,099
Yes.

70
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:05,236
Actors bring history alive
under one terrifying narrative.

71
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:08,072
- Yeah, a living...
- A living piece of shit.

72
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:11,075
See you later, dad.

73
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:14,011
Don't write anything I wouldn't
do.

74
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:23,455
My patience is thin, Mr.
Bremner.

75
00:08:24,522 --> 00:08:26,491
What exactly are you asking?

76
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:35,933
One more week, sir.

77
00:08:39,504 --> 00:08:40,505
One more week, sir.

78
00:08:41,338 --> 00:08:45,309
My boys, they'll work in
the fields until I can pay.

79
00:08:45,342 --> 00:08:47,211
They're fit, strong...

80
00:08:49,313 --> 00:08:53,451
If I wanted labourers,
I'd employ labourers.

81
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:01,225
I have a daughter.

82
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:09,300
And what area of employment
would you presume upon your...

83
00:09:10,535 --> 00:09:12,136
And what area of employment

84
00:09:12,169 --> 00:09:14,972
would you presume upon this
daughter?

85
00:09:19,511 --> 00:09:22,212
She, uh, a maidservant, or...

86
00:09:28,052 --> 00:09:29,053
Or?

87
00:12:26,764 --> 00:12:29,701
Hi, you must be our new
neighbour.

88
00:12:33,303 --> 00:12:34,304
I'm Jenny.

89
00:12:35,807 --> 00:12:36,608
Bee.

90
00:12:36,641 --> 00:12:38,275
It's nice to finally meet you,
Bee.

91
00:12:39,811 --> 00:12:41,679
- Is that short for...
- Beleth.

92
00:12:43,113 --> 00:12:46,083
Beleth, oh, that's nice.

93
00:12:47,485 --> 00:12:48,453
Well, we've been curious to know

94
00:12:48,486 --> 00:12:50,020
who's moved into the castle.

95
00:12:51,154 --> 00:12:53,056
So, your parents with you?

96
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,091
My dad.

97
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,094
Is he gonna fix the place up?

98
00:12:57,862 --> 00:12:59,531
Guess you could say that,
yeah.

99
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:03,367
Gets awful lonely up here.

100
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:07,204
My dad's a writer,
that's kind of the point.

101
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,340
Be good to catch him sometime.

102
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:12,510
You sure about that?

103
00:13:13,578 --> 00:13:15,713
Jack Travis, look him up.

104
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:28,526
Guessing the sheds are
cleared.

105
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,300
I see you got the TV working.

106
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,435
It's been working for ages.

107
00:13:37,468 --> 00:13:39,169
Did you even hear what
I said?

108
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:42,205
Something about making tea or
something?

109
00:13:57,889 --> 00:13:59,390
Where's that tea?

110
00:13:59,424 --> 00:14:00,458
No, no!

111
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:01,759
You can get out there
and take down those sheds

112
00:14:01,793 --> 00:14:03,428
like I've been asking for weeks.

113
00:14:03,461 --> 00:14:05,195
Oh, yeah, 'cause no one's
gonna buy your granny's house

114
00:14:05,228 --> 00:14:06,664
if there's some nasty sheds in
the garden.

115
00:14:06,698 --> 00:14:08,733
Not if they're falling
apart, they won't.

116
00:14:11,803 --> 00:14:13,270
Your family should've
sold this place ages ago,

117
00:14:13,303 --> 00:14:14,672
your granny's been dead for
years.

118
00:14:14,706 --> 00:14:16,273
- Callum!
- What?

119
00:14:16,306 --> 00:14:17,307
I'm not being funny.

120
00:14:17,341 --> 00:14:18,543
You've got to admit,
it's pretty awful timing.

121
00:14:18,576 --> 00:14:21,813
Us having to come all the way
up here and sort it out now.

122
00:14:22,747 --> 00:14:24,749
We're supposed to be taking a
year out.

123
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,219
Is it too cold and
windy in the far north

124
00:14:29,252 --> 00:14:30,655
for poor wee Callum?

125
00:14:30,688 --> 00:14:33,424
More like it's too boring and
shite.

126
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,325
Yeah, well, that's life.

127
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:36,561
Look, you'd only be sat on your
ass

128
00:14:36,594 --> 00:14:38,563
watching TV somewhere else
anyway.

129
00:14:38,596 --> 00:14:39,664
Oh, what was that?

130
00:14:41,766 --> 00:14:43,835
Oh, oh, and what's that,
Callum?

131
00:14:43,868 --> 00:14:46,336
Is that the sound of a big,
manly man

132
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,672
smashing sheds to pieces?

133
00:14:47,705 --> 00:14:49,373
I'll smash you to pieces.

134
00:14:49,407 --> 00:14:50,875
Fat chance.

135
00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:53,176
After everything I've
done for you, Jenny?

136
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,413
Look, you'll get a tea
if you do some bloody work.

137
00:14:55,446 --> 00:14:56,381
Oh, sorry, did I say tea?

138
00:14:56,414 --> 00:14:58,449
I meant coffee.

139
00:14:58,483 --> 00:15:01,386
Coffee helps me do manly things.

140
00:15:08,426 --> 00:15:10,428
Jack Travis in the castle.

141
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:12,797
What was that?

142
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,665
What?

143
00:15:13,698 --> 00:15:14,899
You said a name.

144
00:15:14,932 --> 00:15:16,366
Um, Jack Travis.

145
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:18,736
The writer?

146
00:15:20,672 --> 00:15:21,673
Two seconds.

147
00:15:25,443 --> 00:15:27,445
Here he is, Jack Travis.

148
00:15:28,413 --> 00:15:29,580
What?

149
00:15:29,614 --> 00:15:32,684
Jack Travis is famous, man,
has to be.

150
00:15:32,717 --> 00:15:33,584
Look, he's had this hit West End
play

151
00:15:33,618 --> 00:15:36,421
that scared the shite out of
everyone.

152
00:15:36,454 --> 00:15:38,656
Horrorpreneur, what is that?

153
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,858
I guess it's somebody that's
an expert in scaring people.

154
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,994
That is awesome.

155
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:45,897
Yeah, well, why has he moved
here?

156
00:15:46,798 --> 00:15:48,733
Jack Travis in the frigging
castle.

157
00:16:01,479 --> 00:16:02,847
Katie, truth or dare?

158
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,881
Dare.

159
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:09,352
Okay, I dare you to down
all of that drink in one go.

160
00:16:09,387 --> 00:16:10,655
- I can't.
- Come on.

161
00:16:10,688 --> 00:16:12,957
- No.
- Come on.

162
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:13,958
Yes.

Come on.

166
00:16:17,628 --> 00:16:19,630
- Mm-mm, mm-mm.
- Yeah, come on.

167
00:16:21,432 --> 00:16:22,433
That burns.

168
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:26,571
Okay, Alex, truth or dare?

169
00:16:26,604 --> 00:16:27,605
Truth.

170
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:29,741
Okay.

171
00:16:29,774 --> 00:16:33,444
What was the name of your first
ever

172
00:16:36,047 --> 00:16:36,881
pet?

173
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:37,915
Lame.

174
00:16:38,883 --> 00:16:40,384
You had a pet called Lame?

175
00:16:40,418 --> 00:16:43,521
Ha ha, no.

176
00:16:44,422 --> 00:16:45,523
Bee's turn.

177
00:16:45,556 --> 00:16:50,260
Oh, queen of the castle,
do your worst.

178
00:16:53,363 --> 00:16:54,966
Ticktock, ticktock.

179
00:16:57,835 --> 00:17:00,571
Katie, truth or dare?

180
00:17:00,605 --> 00:17:02,573
Um, truth.

181
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:03,908
Lame.

182
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:05,376
Everybody's frigging lame.

183
00:17:07,011 --> 00:17:09,013
Why are you really friends
with Alex?

184
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:15,887
What sort of a shite question
is that?

185
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,422
Why am I friends with Alex?

186
00:17:18,456 --> 00:17:19,924
'Cause we're friends?

187
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:21,759
I said, why are you really her
friend?

188
00:17:21,793 --> 00:17:23,461
This is fricking stupid.

189
00:17:24,796 --> 00:17:29,801
Uh, 'cause I like her and
she likes me.

190
00:17:30,234 --> 00:17:32,670
Like, honest to god.

191
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:34,005
All right, Bee, truth.

192
00:17:34,705 --> 00:17:37,340
Why do you think Katie's
friends with me, hmm?

193
00:17:38,543 --> 00:17:39,544
I don't know.

194
00:17:40,111 --> 00:17:44,015
Maybe because you make her
feel better about herself,

195
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:48,920
because she's secretly a
good girl and you're a slag.

196
00:17:51,689 --> 00:17:52,690
What the fuck?

197
00:17:55,827 --> 00:17:57,762
What game are you playing at,
woman?

198
00:17:59,063 --> 00:18:00,798
We had an agreement.

199
00:18:06,037 --> 00:18:09,140
I, I couldn't help it, Campbell.

200
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:10,775
He knew already.

201
00:18:16,147 --> 00:18:18,850
Then a curse be on your
footsteps

202
00:18:18,883 --> 00:18:21,953
as you bring service to this
household.

203
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:34,732
This comes from a girl who
sits at the back of the class

204
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:36,801
drawing dragons and
bats all over her work.

205
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:38,069
At least I can draw.

206
00:18:38,102 --> 00:18:39,770
Oh, who gives a
shite?

207
00:18:39,804 --> 00:18:41,505
That's just weird.

208
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:43,441
And how old is your dad,
anyway?

209
00:18:43,474 --> 00:18:46,010
Must have been about 15 when he
had you.

210
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:49,513
Oh, touched a nerve.

211
00:18:49,547 --> 00:18:51,015
At least I know who my dad is.

212
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,585
Uh, piss off, you arrogant
cow.

213
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:55,887
You think you're all so high and
mighty

214
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,421
in your frigging castle, don't
you?

215
00:18:57,455 --> 00:18:58,389
I'd rather live here

216
00:18:58,422 --> 00:19:00,625
than on some shitty
council estate in Wick.

217
00:19:00,658 --> 00:19:02,159
And I'd rather live in
the back of a bin lorry

218
00:19:02,193 --> 00:19:04,662
than this shitehole of
a haunted castle anyway.

219
00:19:04,695 --> 00:19:06,764
Oh my god, a bin
lorry.

220
00:19:06,797 --> 00:19:07,465
You do know why no one else

221
00:19:07,498 --> 00:19:09,133
would come here for a sleepover?

222
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:10,434
I don't think she
knows.

223
00:19:10,468 --> 00:19:11,535
This should be good.

224
00:19:19,543 --> 00:19:21,479
It was a cold, dark

225
00:19:21,512 --> 00:19:23,714
- and stormy night.
- Shut up.

226
00:19:23,748 --> 00:19:27,718
The rain lashed at the
roof tiles like an old granny

227
00:19:27,752 --> 00:19:29,587
pissing herself on the kitchen
floor.

228
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,222
Oh, that's nasty.

229
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:34,992
Okay, so there was this evil
baron who used to live here

230
00:19:35,026 --> 00:19:39,797
called Laird Mackay or some
shite who everyone hated.

231
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,232
And the scandal was,

232
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:44,535
he was shagging his
housekeeping maid, Tabitha.

233
00:19:44,568 --> 00:19:47,672
And obviously she got
up the duff, pregnant.

234
00:19:48,973 --> 00:19:51,976
So they had this son, Alasdair,

235
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:54,211
who, when he was older one
night,

236
00:19:54,245 --> 00:19:57,248
blurts out in front of all
of the Laird's dinner guests,

237
00:19:57,281 --> 00:19:59,183
"My mother's not my real mother.

238
00:19:59,216 --> 00:20:02,153
"My mother's the frigging
maid, you bunch of culls."

239
00:20:04,588 --> 00:20:06,257
But that's the nice part.

240
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:10,761
Laird Mackay chased Alasdair
all the way down to the cellar

241
00:20:10,795 --> 00:20:12,730
here he spent the whole night

242
00:20:12,763 --> 00:20:15,199
building an entire wall around
him,

243
00:20:15,232 --> 00:20:18,869
leaving him to thirst and starve
for days.

244
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,774
And night after night, Alasdair
would cry out for help,

245
00:20:24,475 --> 00:20:29,547
and not even his mother, his
real mother, came to save him.

246
00:20:30,815 --> 00:20:33,217
But there was one who did come.

247
00:20:34,719 --> 00:20:37,054
The devil.

248
00:20:37,088 --> 00:20:38,990
The devil made a pact with
Alasdair.

249
00:20:40,658 --> 00:20:43,094
"You may have your revenge
in this place, Alasdair,

250
00:20:43,828 --> 00:20:48,899
"but you will do my work
for eternity."

251
00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:51,769
Next thing you know, Tabitha is
found dead

252
00:20:51,802 --> 00:20:55,206
at the bottom of the
staircase, every bone broken.

253
00:20:56,273 --> 00:20:58,676
Laird Mackay went insane,

254
00:20:58,709 --> 00:21:01,946
threw himself out of the
highest window in the castle.

255
00:21:01,979 --> 00:21:03,047
Or so they say.

256
00:21:03,748 --> 00:21:06,083
Some say, if you put
your hands to the wall

257
00:21:06,117 --> 00:21:07,918
where Alasdair was buried alive,

258
00:21:07,952 --> 00:21:09,820
you can still hear his screams.

259
00:21:09,854 --> 00:21:12,590
His screams to be set
free again.

260
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:16,794
That's ridiculous.

261
00:21:16,827 --> 00:21:18,095
Then prove it.

262
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:19,597
Dare.

263
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:22,266
I dare you to put your hands on
the wall.

264
00:21:24,001 --> 00:21:25,236
What's the point?

265
00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:27,571
It's just a wall.

266
00:21:27,605 --> 00:21:29,807
A pact with the devil?

267
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,776
Then what are you worried
about?

268
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:32,743
The only thing I'm worried
about

269
00:21:32,777 --> 00:21:34,745
is looking completely stupid.

270
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:38,049
Well, you already
kinda are, so.

271
00:21:41,018 --> 00:21:43,154
You two are doing it as well.

272
00:21:43,187 --> 00:21:45,623
Aye.

273
00:21:45,656 --> 00:21:48,826
You left me no choice,
Tabitha.

274
00:21:48,859 --> 00:21:51,195
Please, Mackay, he's just a boy.

275
00:21:52,797 --> 00:21:54,265
And a boy he shall remain.

276
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,704
Let him go, far from here.

277
00:22:00,738 --> 00:22:03,040
You're his mother, Tabitha.

278
00:22:03,074 --> 00:22:06,610
Would you wish him away so far
from home?

279
00:22:26,398 --> 00:22:28,766
Oh my God, is this it?

280
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,801
It has to be.

281
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,071
Okay, who's first?

282
00:22:35,306 --> 00:22:36,707
You's can frig off.

283
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:38,709
Bee?

284
00:22:40,144 --> 00:22:41,145
Stupid question.

285
00:23:04,168 --> 00:23:05,169
Hm.

286
00:23:07,238 --> 00:23:08,305
Okay, Bee, your turn.

287
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,875
What about Katie?

288
00:23:10,908 --> 00:23:11,909
It's your castle.

289
00:23:17,181 --> 00:23:20,985
This is so stupid.

290
00:24:21,845 --> 00:24:22,846
Hey.

291
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,827
Sorry if I acted like a bitch
yesterday.

292
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,097
I don't think that.

293
00:24:40,998 --> 00:24:43,133
Why do you think you were?

294
00:24:44,235 --> 00:24:45,302
I just hate school.

295
00:24:47,071 --> 00:24:48,072
So did I.

296
00:24:52,843 --> 00:24:53,911
So why the castle?

297
00:24:55,346 --> 00:24:58,215
It's kind of a big old
place for just two people.

298
00:24:58,249 --> 00:24:59,517
My dad's kind of...

299
00:25:02,152 --> 00:25:03,521
He writes weird stuff.

300
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:09,360
What was his last one about?

301
00:25:13,498 --> 00:25:14,499
Never watched it.

302
00:25:16,568 --> 00:25:18,335
You never watched your dad's
play?

303
00:25:28,112 --> 00:25:29,313
What's he working on how?

304
00:25:30,482 --> 00:25:32,249
He has this crazy idea.

305
00:25:32,283 --> 00:25:33,117
What?

306
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,151
I can't say.

307
00:25:36,086 --> 00:25:37,389
I won't tell anyone.

308
00:25:42,394 --> 00:25:45,929
It's immersive, um,
like a walkaround play.

309
00:25:49,066 --> 00:25:50,067
In the castle?

310
00:25:55,105 --> 00:25:56,106
What's it about?

311
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:03,914
Maybe you should come over
sometime.

312
00:30:46,196 --> 00:30:48,833
Shit, I'm just making this
worse.

313
00:30:48,866 --> 00:30:50,668
You're gonna have to
come and do this, love.

314
00:30:53,236 --> 00:30:55,640
Since when did you ever iron a
shirt?

315
00:30:55,673 --> 00:30:58,241
Exactly, that's exactly my
point.

316
00:30:58,275 --> 00:31:00,478
Who are these people
anyway, the crease police?

317
00:31:02,747 --> 00:31:04,482
You don't have to come.

318
00:31:04,515 --> 00:31:07,150
Oh, yeah, yeah, no, uh,
wine and cheese in a castle?

319
00:31:07,184 --> 00:31:08,519
No, I think I might just stay
home,

320
00:31:08,553 --> 00:31:10,320
maybe iron the rest of my
clothes.

321
00:31:13,958 --> 00:31:16,159
So this girl just invited us
over, then?

322
00:31:16,894 --> 00:31:18,596
She's just being nice.

323
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,565
Yeah, well, let's hope they
are, eh?

324
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:23,735
You can always leave.

325
00:31:23,768 --> 00:31:26,303
What do you mean, "You
can always leave"?

326
00:31:26,336 --> 00:31:28,338
I'm beginning to think
you don't want me there.

327
00:31:28,372 --> 00:31:30,775
I didn't mean...

328
00:31:33,711 --> 00:31:36,447
Apparently her dad likes his own
company.

329
00:31:37,882 --> 00:31:39,684
Okay, so why are you going,
then?

330
00:31:42,387 --> 00:31:44,689
Look, Jenny, if I
had something better to do,

331
00:31:44,722 --> 00:31:46,724
believe me, I would go and do
it.

332
00:31:46,758 --> 00:31:49,560
Leave you with all the
socialising with famous writers.

333
00:31:51,361 --> 00:31:52,930
I honestly don't know
how your family survived

334
00:31:52,964 --> 00:31:54,866
growing up round here, I really
don't.

335
00:32:02,473 --> 00:32:05,643
People are afraid of the
dark, aren't they?

336
00:32:05,677 --> 00:32:10,715
It's as though we can just all
forget our deepest troubles

337
00:32:10,748 --> 00:32:13,885
by sitting in a circle,
and stroke some kittens,

338
00:32:13,918 --> 00:32:18,489
and do some mindfulness
exercises.

339
00:32:18,523 --> 00:32:20,858
There's this idea that we're
like, um,

340
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,261
wheelie bins.

341
00:32:25,997 --> 00:32:26,998
Here we go.

342
00:32:27,031 --> 00:32:28,633
No, seriously.

343
00:32:28,666 --> 00:32:32,870
This idea that we're all
just full of rubbish, okay,

344
00:32:32,904 --> 00:32:35,473
and that all we need
to do is just empty it

345
00:32:35,506 --> 00:32:38,376
and do some breathing, stroke an
iguana,

346
00:32:38,409 --> 00:32:39,577
listen to some whale song

347
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:43,448
and bang, it's all
gone.

348
00:32:44,247 --> 00:32:46,484
What would you do with all
this rubbish instead, then?

349
00:32:46,517 --> 00:32:47,685
Well, uh,

350
00:32:47,719 --> 00:32:49,787
if we are going for the
wheelie bin analogy,

351
00:32:49,821 --> 00:32:53,558
which is mine, thank you,
what I would say

352
00:32:53,591 --> 00:32:55,760
is that we need to, uh,

353
00:32:56,527 --> 00:33:00,565
look closely at what's in
the rubbish, go through it

354
00:33:00,598 --> 00:33:04,936
and find what's in there
that might be, uh...

355
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:08,206
Rubbish.

356
00:33:09,807 --> 00:33:13,411
No, um, no, useful.

357
00:33:15,513 --> 00:33:17,982
But isn't it so much easier
to just pay the council tax

358
00:33:18,015 --> 00:33:20,551
and have someone take
it all away?

359
00:33:20,585 --> 00:33:21,886
No self-examination needed.

360
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,589
Well, I suppose that's
the problem, isn't it?

361
00:33:24,622 --> 00:33:26,524
It's always about what's
easiest.

362
00:33:26,557 --> 00:33:27,925
Take Jack, okay?

363
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:31,829
Jack's got his own troubles,
his own rubbish, hm?

364
00:33:31,863 --> 00:33:34,364
You're a writer, I imagine
you use it to write.

365
00:33:35,133 --> 00:33:38,436
You can't write without
some serious reflection,

366
00:33:38,469 --> 00:33:40,303
some self-examination, right?

367
00:33:40,337 --> 00:33:41,472
Oh, you can.

368
00:33:41,506 --> 00:33:42,874
Okay, okay, you can.

369
00:33:42,907 --> 00:33:45,943
But I mean, it wouldn't
be any good, would it?

370
00:33:45,977 --> 00:33:49,380
All you have to do is, you
have to go back to your life,

371
00:33:49,413 --> 00:33:54,385
examine your rubbish, and in
some way turn it into fuel.

372
00:33:55,686 --> 00:33:59,690
I mean, for example, uh, hm,

373
00:33:59,724 --> 00:34:01,993
what was it that fueled
you to buy this place?

374
00:34:04,796 --> 00:34:05,797
A witch.

375
00:34:10,568 --> 00:34:11,636
Sorry, did I say witch?

376
00:34:11,669 --> 00:34:14,038
I meant estate agent.

377
00:34:17,542 --> 00:34:18,576
Oh, you got me.

378
00:34:18,609 --> 00:34:21,078
That just sort of fitted,
didn't it?

379
00:34:21,112 --> 00:34:22,480
See?

380
00:34:22,513 --> 00:34:25,917
Jack's not afraid to go to dark
places.

381
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:27,552
That's where people find
themselves.

382
00:34:27,585 --> 00:34:28,753
If we don't know what we're
afraid of,

383
00:34:28,786 --> 00:34:31,455
then how can we know anything at
all?

384
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:33,858
We know ourselves from
the decisions we make.

385
00:34:38,462 --> 00:34:39,964
Yeah, okay, to a degree,
but...

386
00:34:39,997 --> 00:34:41,098
Why don't we ask Bee?

387
00:34:42,834 --> 00:34:44,969
Bee, what's that short for
again?

388
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:46,671
I told you, Beleth.

389
00:34:48,472 --> 00:34:50,775
Oh, isn't Beleth a demon?

390
00:34:50,808 --> 00:34:51,976
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

391
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:53,144
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

392
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:56,447
He's the, one of the gods
of hell, isn't he?

393
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,851
He had like 85 legions of
demons, of...

394
00:35:15,433 --> 00:35:16,934
Why would a Cambridge student

395
00:35:16,968 --> 00:35:20,004
decide to have a child
before he graduated?

396
00:35:24,508 --> 00:35:25,710
Okay.

397
00:35:25,743 --> 00:35:28,746
Or maybe it was because he
didn't decide to have a child.

398
00:35:28,779 --> 00:35:30,681
- Maybe it just happened...
- That's enough.

399
00:35:30,715 --> 00:35:33,517
And he thought, can't change
shit now.

400
00:35:33,551 --> 00:35:34,886
That's enough.

401
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:37,521
Bee, Bee, wait.

402
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:41,726
What is all that shit in your
office?

403
00:35:41,759 --> 00:35:43,461
What, this place is haunted?

404
00:35:43,494 --> 00:35:44,528
Don't be ridiculous.

405
00:35:44,562 --> 00:35:46,864
Well, what's with the
paranormal murder inquiry

406
00:35:46,898 --> 00:35:48,032
pinned to your fucking wall?

407
00:35:48,065 --> 00:35:50,801
It's nothing, it's
just folklore and rumours.

408
00:35:50,835 --> 00:35:53,738
And you're all over it
like a fly around shit.

409
00:35:53,771 --> 00:35:54,906
That's enough.

410
00:35:56,574 --> 00:35:59,744
We wouldn't even have this
place if it wasn't for all that.

411
00:35:59,777 --> 00:36:03,514
I never even wanted this
place.

412
00:36:03,547 --> 00:36:06,117
God, Mum was right, it's all
about you.

413
00:36:06,984 --> 00:36:08,185
You're messed up.

414
00:36:16,027 --> 00:36:17,828
You listen here, Beleth.

415
00:36:17,862 --> 00:36:20,698
I am this close to something
great.

416
00:36:20,731 --> 00:36:22,166
Thousands of people will come
here

417
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:25,169
and experience something they
have never before imagined.

418
00:36:25,202 --> 00:36:27,038
I don't care.

419
00:36:27,071 --> 00:36:29,840
You need to start honouring
everything I've done for you,

420
00:36:29,874 --> 00:36:32,143
you feckless waste of skin.

421
00:36:33,544 --> 00:36:35,079
Dad, let go of me.

422
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,076
I'm not saying
don't do it.

423
00:39:52,109 --> 00:39:53,244
Just think about it, Jack,

424
00:39:53,277 --> 00:39:54,479
- it's a long way away.
- From where?

425
00:39:54,513 --> 00:39:57,915
I don't want people just nipping
out from London at high tea

426
00:39:57,948 --> 00:40:00,452
to pop in on Jack Travis's new
play thing.

427
00:40:00,485 --> 00:40:02,186
This is a whole new level of
experience.

428
00:40:02,219 --> 00:40:03,687
I know what
you're trying to do.

429
00:40:03,721 --> 00:40:06,090
I'm sorry, I don't think you
do.

430
00:40:06,123 --> 00:40:07,691
People will come for days.

431
00:40:07,725 --> 00:40:08,893
Well, they'll have to.

432
00:40:08,926 --> 00:40:09,760
Days?

433
00:40:09,793 --> 00:40:10,961
Weeks, months.

434
00:40:10,995 --> 00:40:13,864
They'll quit the rat race and
build houses on the beach.

435
00:40:15,032 --> 00:40:16,033
Samantha?

436
00:40:17,435 --> 00:40:18,537
Samantha?

437
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:21,338
I love your
passion, Jack, you know I do.

438
00:40:21,372 --> 00:40:24,909
The whole thing does add
colour to your story.

439
00:40:24,942 --> 00:40:26,744
Who's gonna back you?

440
00:40:28,112 --> 00:40:29,447
I've got backing.

441
00:40:29,481 --> 00:40:30,314
Really?

442
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:32,950
The whole thing's coming
together.

443
00:40:32,983 --> 00:40:33,817
Well, I'm happy for
you,

444
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:35,186
because all I'm hearing

445
00:40:35,219 --> 00:40:36,887
is that none of the major
players are interested.

446
00:40:36,921 --> 00:40:38,423
It's too off the beaten track.

447
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:44,028
Aye, well, perhaps that's for
the best.

448
00:40:44,061 --> 00:40:45,963
What?

449
00:40:45,996 --> 00:40:48,466
Call me when you're back in
London.

450
00:40:53,337 --> 00:40:56,508
We'll show them, won't we,
Alasdair?

451
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:57,975
Father and son.

452
00:41:37,382 --> 00:41:38,383
Hey.

453
00:41:41,118 --> 00:41:42,286
Pull up a seat.

454
00:41:44,054 --> 00:41:45,789
How's the writing
going?

455
00:41:47,891 --> 00:41:51,195
You know, there used to be
a whole village over there.

456
00:41:53,964 --> 00:41:55,467
That what you're writing
about?

457
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,002
- Depends.
- Depends on what?

458
00:41:58,035 --> 00:42:00,505
On whether I can
provide disabled access.

459
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:03,240
How's Bee?

460
00:42:04,609 --> 00:42:05,809
Bee?

461
00:42:07,211 --> 00:42:08,212
Bee.

462
00:42:10,147 --> 00:42:11,348
Let me see.

463
00:42:11,383 --> 00:42:13,284
You ever think maybe your
interest in darkness and evil...

464
00:42:13,317 --> 00:42:14,318
No.

465
00:42:19,056 --> 00:42:20,458
She's a teenager.

466
00:42:20,492 --> 00:42:21,693
She seems troubled.

467
00:42:21,726 --> 00:42:24,895
And she'll probably be very
successful like her father.

468
00:42:28,165 --> 00:42:30,000
How much do you want for it?

469
00:42:30,034 --> 00:42:31,101
Want for what?

470
00:42:31,135 --> 00:42:32,236
I can help you.

471
00:42:32,269 --> 00:42:34,938
You can move back to Glasgow,
get on with your lives.

472
00:42:34,972 --> 00:42:36,240
I don't think my great
grandmother

473
00:42:36,273 --> 00:42:37,107
- would approve.
- Ah,

474
00:42:37,141 --> 00:42:39,209
so the bungalow was hers.

475
00:42:40,911 --> 00:42:42,447
I take it she's no longer with
us?

476
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,481
Oh, no, she is.

477
00:42:45,282 --> 00:42:47,217
She's buried in your back
garden.

478
00:43:11,543 --> 00:43:12,544
Bee?

479
00:45:33,116 --> 00:45:34,117
Tabitha.

480
00:45:42,827 --> 00:45:47,231
Your great grandmother was
Mackay's maid.

481
00:45:51,436 --> 00:45:53,103
You have no idea what you're
doing.

482
00:45:53,136 --> 00:45:55,239
- Tell me.
- Get away from me!

483
00:45:55,272 --> 00:45:57,475
What's the matter, Jenny?

484
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:10,087
It's too late.

485
00:46:44,722 --> 00:46:47,157
Hey, hey, baby.

486
00:46:49,527 --> 00:46:50,628
What you writing?

487
00:46:50,662 --> 00:46:52,329
Right, do you remember
that time we went to Ullapool

488
00:46:52,362 --> 00:46:53,196
and we kept missing everything

489
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:55,600
because we couldn't get out on
time?

490
00:46:55,633 --> 00:46:59,671
The shops, the,
remember the ferry?

491
00:46:59,704 --> 00:47:02,574
The whisky thing, the...

492
00:47:02,607 --> 00:47:03,474
Well, I'm taking that idea,
right,

493
00:47:03,508 --> 00:47:06,143
this couple who just can't seem
to do

494
00:47:06,176 --> 00:47:08,446
- that they want to do...
- You're writing a play?

495
00:47:13,484 --> 00:47:15,285
What if we don't sell this
place?

496
00:47:15,987 --> 00:47:18,590
What if we move here
permanently?

497
00:47:18,623 --> 00:47:21,191
Do it up, do the gardens,
everything, right?

498
00:47:21,224 --> 00:47:24,261
You can keep teaching,
I can start writing.

499
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:27,865
Look, I know, I know it sounds
crazy.

500
00:47:27,899 --> 00:47:29,400
But just think, if I can get
Jack's help,

501
00:47:29,434 --> 00:47:31,168
his connections, then...

502
00:47:31,201 --> 00:47:32,269
What are you doing?

503
00:47:33,905 --> 00:47:35,473
What?

504
00:47:35,506 --> 00:47:38,241
I'm thinking about us, about our
future.

505
00:47:41,446 --> 00:47:42,747
I fucking hate teaching.

506
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,816
Callum, you can't stand it
here.

507
00:47:44,849 --> 00:47:46,851
Yeah, but that's because I'm a
nobody.

508
00:47:46,884 --> 00:47:48,519
I'm what, I'm a teacher on
sabbatical

509
00:47:48,553 --> 00:47:50,922
trying to clean out his
grandmother in law's

510
00:47:50,955 --> 00:47:52,824
shitty old bungalow.

511
00:47:52,857 --> 00:47:55,125
It's like Damacles' sword
hanging over me.

512
00:47:56,527 --> 00:47:59,797
Look, I've really got
a shot here with Jack.

513
00:48:00,965 --> 00:48:02,700
- The guy's right there.
- No.

514
00:48:02,734 --> 00:48:05,637
No, I don't want you going over
there.

515
00:48:05,670 --> 00:48:07,170
You still haven't taken down
those sheds.

516
00:48:07,204 --> 00:48:09,507
What the hell is wrong with
you?

517
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,709
I thought you wanted to move
back up here.

518
00:48:11,743 --> 00:48:14,311
You're not a writer, Callum.

519
00:48:14,344 --> 00:48:15,345
Get a grip.

520
00:48:16,279 --> 00:48:18,716
Can't just suddenly do this in
the middle of us trying to...

521
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:19,917
Trying to what, Jenny?

522
00:48:25,556 --> 00:48:26,758
At least I'm trying to make
something

523
00:48:26,791 --> 00:48:28,393
of this awful situation.

524
00:49:16,841 --> 00:49:18,609
Come on.

525
00:49:18,643 --> 00:49:22,580
Come on, Alasdair, I know you're
in there.

526
00:49:22,613 --> 00:49:24,649
Talk to me, talk to me!

527
00:49:25,817 --> 00:49:27,350
What's the matter?

528
00:49:27,385 --> 00:49:29,420
Is this where Mackay put you?

529
00:49:29,454 --> 00:49:30,822
Where he starved you?

530
00:49:30,855 --> 00:49:35,626
That's what you get
when you disrespect me.

531
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:39,430
I gave you everything and
you spat it back in my face!

532
00:49:39,464 --> 00:49:41,466
Couldn't help yourself, could
you,

533
00:49:41,499 --> 00:49:43,801
exposing your mother's shame!

534
00:49:54,378 --> 00:49:59,383
Who's that?

535
00:50:06,591 --> 00:50:07,592
Who's there?

536
00:50:27,512 --> 00:50:28,746
Who's there?

537
00:50:30,581 --> 00:50:31,582
Bee?

538
00:50:37,388 --> 00:50:39,457
Don't come in.

539
00:50:41,859 --> 00:50:42,860
Okay.

540
00:50:47,832 --> 00:50:48,933
What's the matter?

541
00:50:51,002 --> 00:50:52,003
Where have you been?

542
00:50:57,842 --> 00:51:00,044
Why don't you want me to see
you?

543
00:51:00,077 --> 00:51:01,879
You haven't missed
me.

544
00:51:03,047 --> 00:51:04,048
Yes I have.

545
00:51:04,849 --> 00:51:08,586
I came back to
help, but you don't want me.

546
00:51:13,424 --> 00:51:14,759
Help with what?

547
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:05,443
Shit.

548
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,495
Hi, Jack.

549
00:52:24,528 --> 00:52:28,766
Sorry, the ole' door was open.

550
00:52:39,911 --> 00:52:40,978
So how's it all going?

551
00:52:41,779 --> 00:52:44,615
Yeah, I know how that
feels.

552
00:52:44,649 --> 00:52:47,118
The creative process, huh?

553
00:52:47,151 --> 00:52:48,452
Oh, speaking of which, I was...

554
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:00,064
Eh, what are we drinking to?

555
00:53:00,097 --> 00:53:01,933
You know why I bought
this place, Callum?

556
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:06,103
No.

557
00:53:06,137 --> 00:53:09,473
You know what happens
when you tell people

558
00:53:10,174 --> 00:53:11,809
that you own a castle?

559
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:15,212
No, what's that?

560
00:53:15,246 --> 00:53:18,482
Sex and drugs.

561
00:53:20,084 --> 00:53:20,785
Eh?

562
00:53:20,818 --> 00:53:23,087
- I'll drink to that.
- Yeah.

563
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,523
So, what's with the papers?

564
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:27,525
Ah, it's just a play.

565
00:53:27,558 --> 00:53:28,893
Play?

566
00:53:28,926 --> 00:53:30,061
Whose play, your play?

567
00:53:30,094 --> 00:53:31,762
Well, I mean, it's just
notes at the moment, but...

568
00:53:31,796 --> 00:53:33,197
Well, then perform it.

569
00:53:33,965 --> 00:53:35,967
Oh, no, no, no, no, it's not
finished.

570
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,001
Oh, you must.

571
00:53:37,034 --> 00:53:39,937
A play is not for writing,
it's for performing.

572
00:53:39,971 --> 00:53:41,238
Well, couldn't I just
tell you what it's about?

573
00:53:41,272 --> 00:53:43,140
I don't wanna know what it's
about.

574
00:53:43,174 --> 00:53:47,278
I want to experience it
live in the flesh, huh?

575
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:52,183
I wanna feel it like a cat
clawing up my clavicle,

576
00:53:52,216 --> 00:53:57,221
searing my sinews, feasting
on my festering soul.

577
00:53:57,755 --> 00:54:02,760
I want you to make love to my
loins with your words, Callum.

578
00:54:02,793 --> 00:54:06,063
Rain death down upon my
dissident psyche.

579
00:54:06,097 --> 00:54:10,901
Forget your notes, I want your
play

580
00:54:12,269 --> 00:54:13,270
inside me.

581
00:54:15,072 --> 00:54:17,675
Inside me the way that Jenny's
ancestors

582
00:54:17,708 --> 00:54:19,877
are inside this place.

583
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:22,580
What?

584
00:54:22,613 --> 00:54:25,549
You know, her great grandmother
thrown down the stairs,

585
00:54:25,583 --> 00:54:26,817
used and abused.

586
00:54:26,851 --> 00:54:29,787
Her great uncle left
to starve in the wall.

587
00:54:37,094 --> 00:54:39,196
Please, Callum,
listen...

588
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:40,064
You lied to me, Jenny.

589
00:54:40,097 --> 00:54:40,931
Please.

590
00:54:40,965 --> 00:54:42,533
This is some heavy shit.

591
00:54:44,035 --> 00:54:45,536
- You need counselling.
- Counselling?

592
00:54:46,937 --> 00:54:49,607
I spent my entire
childhood being counselled

593
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,108
by everyone who had an opinion.

594
00:54:51,142 --> 00:54:52,243
Exactly.

595
00:54:52,276 --> 00:54:53,711
No wonder you can't look out the
window

596
00:54:53,744 --> 00:54:54,912
without freaking out.

597
00:54:54,945 --> 00:54:57,681
He's got no idea what he's
doing, digging up all this.

598
00:54:57,715 --> 00:55:00,217
There's supposed to be
a curse on that castle,

599
00:55:00,251 --> 00:55:01,786
a fricking curse.

600
00:55:02,753 --> 00:55:04,755
Your great granny was
standing in this kitchen

601
00:55:04,789 --> 00:55:06,090
making beef bridies

602
00:55:06,123 --> 00:55:09,160
while her son starved to
death inside a fucking wall?

603
00:55:13,697 --> 00:55:15,066
You wanted to find out if it's
all true,

604
00:55:15,099 --> 00:55:16,734
if he's bringing it all back.

605
00:55:16,767 --> 00:55:18,702
- Callum...
- Sweetheart,

606
00:55:18,736 --> 00:55:19,703
you need help.

607
00:55:19,737 --> 00:55:21,072
Callum, please.

608
00:55:22,807 --> 00:55:25,743
He wants people to laugh at
my great grandmother's murder.

609
00:55:28,646 --> 00:55:31,649
My granny, my Mum.

610
00:55:36,253 --> 00:55:38,923
It gets a hold of you, it won't
let go.

611
00:55:38,956 --> 00:55:39,924
Well, then, why did we move
here, then?

612
00:55:39,957 --> 00:55:43,227
Because I can't bring
a child into this world

613
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:45,296
if there's still something
there.

614
00:57:37,074 --> 00:57:38,042
Jenny.

615
00:57:39,843 --> 00:57:41,845
Hello, what are you doing here?

616
00:57:43,214 --> 00:57:44,181
I think we should have a talk.

617
00:57:44,215 --> 00:57:45,517
Don't you?

618
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:48,886
Uh, have a seat, make yourself
at home.

619
00:57:48,919 --> 00:57:50,221
Shouldn't be too hard.

620
00:57:50,254 --> 00:57:51,855
What's on your mind, neighbour?

621
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:55,192
I need to know what you're
working on,

622
00:57:56,327 --> 00:57:58,762
who it's about, what happens.

623
00:57:58,796 --> 00:58:01,265
I'm afraid I can't
discuss that with you.

624
00:58:01,298 --> 00:58:02,467
Will you excuse me?

625
00:58:03,367 --> 00:58:04,335
We're out of coal.

626
00:58:04,368 --> 00:58:05,869
Leave it.

627
00:58:05,903 --> 00:58:09,206
I said we're out of coal.

628
00:58:15,145 --> 00:58:15,980
Jenny.

629
00:58:16,013 --> 00:58:17,014
- Callum.
- Go home.

630
00:58:17,047 --> 00:58:19,149
This is between me and Jack.

631
00:58:19,183 --> 00:58:20,217
Over my dead body it is.

632
00:58:20,251 --> 00:58:22,853
Oh, please, I don't
want to cause any trouble.

633
00:58:23,555 --> 00:58:25,557
Callum, would you be a darling

634
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:27,958
and go and fetch us some more
coal?

635
00:58:27,992 --> 00:58:30,127
It's much more cheerier with a
fire.

636
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,229
We're not here for a soiree,
Jack.

637
00:58:32,263 --> 00:58:33,264
Please!

638
00:58:34,865 --> 00:58:36,534
Downstairs, I insist.

639
00:58:48,178 --> 00:58:49,813
Might as well get cosy, yeah?

640
00:59:36,026 --> 00:59:37,027
Bee?

641
00:59:37,895 --> 00:59:42,066
So your great grandmother
was Mackay's maidservant,

642
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,269
the illicit mother of Alasdair
Mackay,

643
00:59:45,302 --> 00:59:47,871
the devil's own tortured
servant of the night.

644
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,009
I suppose you don't want
me to make anything of it,

645
00:59:52,042 --> 00:59:53,911
keep it in the wheelie bin.

646
00:59:53,944 --> 00:59:57,515
What gives you the right to
come up here, dig up my past

647
00:59:57,549 --> 01:00:01,151
and put it on display like
some gothic freak show?

648
01:00:01,185 --> 01:00:02,886
I wasn't aware it was buried.

649
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:05,490
I'll tell you what I am
very interested to dig up

650
01:00:05,523 --> 01:00:10,361
is why a young woman so
traumatised by her dreadful,

651
01:00:11,061 --> 01:00:14,365
dreadful past would
choose to live next door

652
01:00:14,399 --> 01:00:17,234
to the very place where her
family were so

653
01:00:20,204 --> 01:00:21,205
affected?

654
01:00:21,806 --> 01:00:25,342
It strikes me, if anybody's
digging anything up, it's you.

655
01:00:26,511 --> 01:00:28,178
And what about Bee?

656
01:00:28,212 --> 01:00:29,880
What does she make of all this?

657
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,121
There's your coal.

658
01:00:39,691 --> 01:00:41,091
Let's go, Jenny.

659
01:00:41,125 --> 01:00:42,226
I'm not finished.

660
01:00:42,259 --> 01:00:43,428
Yes you are, let's go.

661
01:00:43,461 --> 01:00:44,596
Callum, I'm not leaving.

662
01:00:44,629 --> 01:00:46,096
Jenny, we're going.

663
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:47,399
Like hell we are.

664
01:00:48,232 --> 01:00:52,670
Look, I don't know
what's going on here, okay,

665
01:00:52,704 --> 01:00:55,239
but I don't like it, any of it.

666
01:00:57,207 --> 01:00:59,544
Whatever happened to your
family here was awful.

667
01:01:00,478 --> 01:01:04,716
All I know is that we need to
leave now.

668
01:01:04,749 --> 01:01:06,718
What is it?

669
01:01:06,751 --> 01:01:07,951
Oh, shit!

670
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:09,521
We need to go!

671
01:01:20,765 --> 01:01:22,032
You wee devil.

672
01:01:37,582 --> 01:01:38,583
Very good, Beleth.

673
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:44,354
You can come out now.

674
01:03:05,235 --> 01:03:06,504
Nice place.

675
01:03:18,248 --> 01:03:19,450
It's a little draughty.

676
01:03:20,818 --> 01:03:23,353
I should write a piece on this.

677
01:03:23,388 --> 01:03:26,791
Let me guess, feckless
playwright

678
01:03:26,824 --> 01:03:29,359
buys Scottish castle to bolster
career.

679
01:03:29,394 --> 01:03:33,631
I was thinking more tortured
artist

680
01:03:34,766 --> 01:03:39,637
escapes ex-wife at castle from
hell.

681
01:03:40,705 --> 01:03:42,306
Clearly I failed.

682
01:03:42,339 --> 01:03:43,608
Oh, no.

683
01:03:43,641 --> 01:03:46,243
You still look a little tortured
to me.

684
01:03:49,414 --> 01:03:51,281
Are you gonna give me the grand
tour?

685
01:03:52,584 --> 01:03:53,751
You shouldn't be here.

686
01:03:55,152 --> 01:03:56,153
I'm working.

687
01:03:58,456 --> 01:04:00,592
What are you working on?

688
01:04:01,626 --> 01:04:03,226
- A story.
- Story.

689
01:04:06,898 --> 01:04:08,198
Is it about me?

690
01:04:08,231 --> 01:04:09,567
I haven't finished it yet.

691
01:04:09,601 --> 01:04:11,536
You should finish it.

692
01:04:13,404 --> 01:04:14,371
Get out.

693
01:04:17,575 --> 01:04:19,309
Where is she?

694
01:04:19,343 --> 01:04:20,478
You can't see her.

695
01:04:20,511 --> 01:04:21,144
Why?

696
01:04:21,178 --> 01:04:22,212
What have you done with her?

697
01:04:22,245 --> 01:04:24,515
- What have I done with her?
- I'm Bee's mother.

698
01:04:24,549 --> 01:04:25,550
Her mother?

699
01:04:26,851 --> 01:04:28,686
Welcome home.

700
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:29,921
You call this a home?

701
01:04:29,954 --> 01:04:31,656
Oh, no, no, no.

702
01:04:33,424 --> 01:04:35,627
This is more than just a home.

703
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:40,665
You are full of shit, Jack
Travis.

704
01:05:06,691 --> 01:05:07,925
Oh, Jack.

705
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:56,067
Shit.

706
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:57,902
You stay there, love.

707
01:07:03,708 --> 01:07:04,842
What do you want, Jack?

708
01:07:06,878 --> 01:07:08,746
She's, she's, she's dead.

709
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:09,480
What?

710
01:07:09,514 --> 01:07:10,715
- She's dead.
- Who's dead?

711
01:07:10,748 --> 01:07:11,783
- Who's dead?
- I told you,

712
01:07:11,816 --> 01:07:12,817
stay in the room.

713
01:07:15,019 --> 01:07:16,621
It's Beleth.

714
01:07:16,654 --> 01:07:18,623
What, Bee's dead?

715
01:07:18,656 --> 01:07:19,657
No.

716
01:07:21,125 --> 01:07:22,493
What is it, Jack?

717
01:07:22,527 --> 01:07:23,594
Kathryn, Kathryn...

718
01:07:23,628 --> 01:07:24,929
Listen to me, Jack.

719
01:07:24,962 --> 01:07:26,998
What the hell is going on here?

720
01:07:27,031 --> 01:07:28,666
Kathryn, Kathryn.

721
01:07:28,699 --> 01:07:30,835
- Who, who's dead?
- Kathryn!

722
01:07:30,868 --> 01:07:32,904
She shouldn't even be here,
she should be in London.

723
01:07:32,937 --> 01:07:33,838
I don't...

724
01:07:33,871 --> 01:07:34,772
Where is she?

725
01:07:34,806 --> 01:07:35,840
Where is she, Jack?

726
01:07:36,741 --> 01:07:37,775
Jack, where is she now?

727
01:07:37,809 --> 01:07:40,611
The stairs, the stairs,
the bottom of the stairs.

728
01:07:40,645 --> 01:07:42,747
- We're coming over.
- I'm getting my coat.

729
01:08:27,992 --> 01:08:28,993
Wait.

730
01:09:17,675 --> 01:09:18,676
She's gone.

731
01:09:20,244 --> 01:09:21,612
Doesn't make any sense.

732
01:09:21,646 --> 01:09:23,514
Makes perfect sense.

733
01:09:23,547 --> 01:09:25,950
Bee, Bee.

734
01:09:30,755 --> 01:09:32,990
- Wait, hey...
- Let go of me.

735
01:09:33,024 --> 01:09:34,425
Hey!

736
01:09:36,027 --> 01:09:37,762
Where's Bee?

737
01:09:37,795 --> 01:09:39,163
She's not here.

738
01:09:39,196 --> 01:09:41,732
What do you mean, she's not
here?

739
01:09:42,733 --> 01:09:45,469
Something is happening.

740
01:09:45,503 --> 01:09:46,771
Damn right it is.

741
01:09:46,804 --> 01:09:49,106
Something wonderful.

742
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:51,475
Where's Bee, Jack?

743
01:09:51,509 --> 01:09:53,511
I'll tell you exactly what's
happening.

744
01:09:53,544 --> 01:09:54,545
Someone's losing his frigging
mind.

745
01:09:54,578 --> 01:09:55,813
It's not like that.

746
01:09:55,846 --> 01:09:57,515
No?

747
01:09:57,548 --> 01:09:59,717
Well, then where's your
ex wife's dead body?

748
01:10:01,552 --> 01:10:04,989
Jack, where's Bee?

749
01:10:06,958 --> 01:10:07,959
I don't know.

750
01:10:09,827 --> 01:10:11,162
How long has she been missing?

751
01:10:12,263 --> 01:10:16,534
Goodness sake, Jack, open your
eyes.

752
01:10:18,235 --> 01:10:21,605
Look at what's happening to you.

753
01:10:21,639 --> 01:10:26,644
You have to stop this.

754
01:11:53,364 --> 01:11:55,599
I helped you finish
your play.

755
01:11:59,203 --> 01:12:00,738
Everyone was scared.

756
01:12:03,741 --> 01:12:05,076
Yes, they were.

757
01:12:07,812 --> 01:12:10,314
How are you doing all of this?

758
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:23,694
Beleth?

759
01:12:28,065 --> 01:12:29,800
No one will come, you
know.

760
01:12:30,734 --> 01:12:31,735
Come where?

761
01:12:33,037 --> 01:12:34,338
To the living play.

762
01:12:37,108 --> 01:12:38,642
Why do you say that?

763
01:12:38,676 --> 01:12:40,744
We need to start
again

764
01:12:40,778 --> 01:12:42,346
so people will be scared for
real.

765
01:12:45,383 --> 01:12:48,018
Why can't you come back,

766
01:12:50,721 --> 01:12:52,022
huh, as you were?

767
01:12:56,927 --> 01:12:58,095
We'll do it together.

768
01:13:01,765 --> 01:13:03,801
We are doing this together.

769
01:13:38,235 --> 01:13:39,236
Hi, girls.

770
01:13:40,037 --> 01:13:41,105
Hi.

771
01:13:41,138 --> 01:13:42,840
Where are you off to?

772
01:13:42,873 --> 01:13:43,941
Seeing a friend.

773
01:13:43,974 --> 01:13:46,744
- Sorry, who are you?
- Are you friends with Bee?

774
01:13:46,777 --> 01:13:49,213
Um, depends what you mean by
friends.

775
01:13:49,246 --> 01:13:50,080
She's in our class.

776
01:13:50,114 --> 01:13:51,348
Have you heard from her?

777
01:13:52,417 --> 01:13:54,285
We're not her frigging
secretary.

778
01:13:54,318 --> 01:13:55,152
Bee's weird like that,

779
01:13:55,186 --> 01:13:57,321
she'll just drop off the radar
for days

780
01:13:57,354 --> 01:13:58,722
and then show up when she wants.

781
01:13:58,756 --> 01:14:00,291
When did you last see her?

782
01:14:00,324 --> 01:14:01,325
When we had a sleepover.

783
01:14:01,358 --> 01:14:02,760
Did something happen?

784
01:14:02,793 --> 01:14:04,094
No.

785
01:14:04,128 --> 01:14:05,129
Come on.

786
01:14:09,166 --> 01:14:10,167
Is Bee missing?

787
01:14:10,834 --> 01:14:12,269
Just tell me what happened.

788
01:14:12,303 --> 01:14:13,837
Come on, Katie.

789
01:14:13,871 --> 01:14:14,506
Nice to meet you.

790
01:14:14,539 --> 01:14:15,739
No, please.

791
01:14:16,807 --> 01:14:18,209
Did something bad happen?

792
01:14:19,843 --> 01:14:21,312
Something at the wall?

793
01:14:24,315 --> 01:14:25,316
She screamed.

794
01:14:27,218 --> 01:14:29,787
When she touched the wall, she
screamed.

795
01:14:32,156 --> 01:14:33,491
You need to go home.

796
01:14:33,525 --> 01:14:34,925
- What?
- Now.

797
01:14:34,959 --> 01:14:36,126
You need to leave, go on!

798
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:38,862
- What the fuck?
- Let's just go.

799
01:14:40,164 --> 01:14:41,131
Callum!

800
01:14:49,441 --> 01:14:50,442
Callum!

801
01:15:19,571 --> 01:15:20,971
What do you want, Jack?

802
01:15:24,241 --> 01:15:25,809
What do I want?

803
01:15:30,047 --> 01:15:31,549
I want to be left alone

804
01:15:32,883 --> 01:15:35,553
to do whatever the fuck I want.

805
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:39,923
You peasants

806
01:15:41,091 --> 01:15:44,462
coming in here like you've
something important to say.

807
01:15:48,566 --> 01:15:50,067
What do you want?

808
01:15:52,169 --> 01:15:55,973
I want you to calm down and
listen to what I'm saying.

809
01:15:57,107 --> 01:15:59,243
You being here is a problem for
me.

810
01:16:02,547 --> 01:16:07,552
Callum, I thought we were
gonna work together.

811
01:16:09,119 --> 01:16:12,022
You and me?

812
01:16:12,056 --> 01:16:16,193
Look, we can't have all this
heavy shit

813
01:16:16,226 --> 01:16:18,630
being paraded on our doorstep.

814
01:16:18,663 --> 01:16:20,297
Jenny's fragile.

815
01:16:27,204 --> 01:16:29,106
She needs to let go of all this.

816
01:16:31,676 --> 01:16:34,278
It's not right for her to
carry that sort of pain.

817
01:16:38,248 --> 01:16:39,983
Jack, there's no shame in it.

818
01:16:40,017 --> 01:16:41,051
You can work on something else,

819
01:16:41,085 --> 01:16:44,355
something people will
actually want to remember.

820
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:55,065
Jack, are you hearing what I'm
saying?

821
01:16:57,034 --> 01:17:02,039
This has to end.

822
01:17:32,537 --> 01:17:33,671
Jenny.

823
01:17:38,410 --> 01:17:40,010
Jack!

824
01:17:40,043 --> 01:17:42,514
Jack let me out of here now!

825
01:18:29,594 --> 01:18:31,161
Get out of here.

826
01:19:17,809 --> 01:19:22,747
You let me out
of here now!

827
01:19:32,356 --> 01:19:35,827
Ah!

828
01:19:55,713 --> 01:19:59,551
Everything we've
worked for.

829
01:19:59,584 --> 01:20:01,553
I never wanted this.

830
01:20:01,586 --> 01:20:03,454
You never wanted me.

831
01:20:05,857 --> 01:20:07,725
What are you?

832
01:20:44,696 --> 01:20:46,497
Tell me what you are!

833
01:20:47,432 --> 01:20:48,766
You created me.

834
01:21:19,931 --> 01:21:22,132
You are not my daughter!

835
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:34,405
Bee.

836
01:22:47,618 --> 01:22:48,619
Jenny.

837
01:22:57,294 --> 01:22:58,295
Oh.

838
01:23:07,805 --> 01:23:08,840
Bee, wake up.

839
01:23:11,374 --> 01:23:12,977
Bee, can you hear me?

840
01:23:35,066 --> 01:23:37,300
Bee, Bee, oh, Bee!

841
01:23:38,803 --> 01:23:41,338
Shh, you're okay.

842
01:24:38,179 --> 01:24:43,179
