1
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,380
Bye, Daddy.

2
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,885
-Morning, gentlemen.
-Good morning, sir.

3
00:06:29,445 --> 00:06:31,915
See you tonight, Dad!

4
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,070
Work hard!

5
00:06:57,525 --> 00:06:58,940
Good morning, Céline.

6
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,365
Good morning, Mr. Oscar.

7
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:26,815
Many appointments today, Céline?

8
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:28,650
Nine, Mr. Oscar.

9
00:07:29,035 --> 00:07:31,610
The first file's next to you.

10
00:07:51,145 --> 00:07:52,605
Hello, Serge.

11
00:07:54,465 --> 00:07:56,705
187%, I think.

12
00:07:57,015 --> 00:07:58,710
At 5009.

13
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,850
6 point 6 by 7-2-2.

14
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,720
Indexed, indexed.

15
00:08:07,985 --> 00:08:09,855
Yes, they're after our hide.

16
00:08:09,895 --> 00:08:13,445
We get the blame for their pain.

17
00:08:13,465 --> 00:08:15,030
It whips people up.

18
00:08:15,055 --> 00:08:16,665
A sign of the times.

19
00:08:18,825 --> 00:08:21,040
I had Defrasnoux on the phone

20
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,660
from Wilkinson & Sons.

21
00:08:22,745 --> 00:08:24,370
He was very clear,

22
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,080
bodyguards are no longer enough.

23
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,075
We've got to get guns, too. Fast.

24
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,450
He suggests Caracal 9x19s.

25
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,365
Semi-automatic, 86mm.

26
00:08:43,615 --> 00:08:46,195
Okay, this evening at Fouquet's.

27
00:08:48,385 --> 00:08:50,545
Have a good day, Serge.

28
00:11:23,845 --> 00:11:24,985
Yes.

29
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:29,110
For years and years, it's all I've seen,

30
00:11:29,975 --> 00:11:32,910
stone and feet.

31
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,915
No,

32
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,110
nobody loves me,

33
00:11:41,795 --> 00:11:43,280
nowhere.

34
00:11:44,575 --> 00:11:47,155
But I'm alive anyway.

35
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,955
I am so old...

36
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,610
I'm afraid

37
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,125
I'll never die.

38
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,495
Mr. Oscar,

39
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,015
the file for your second
appointment's next to you.

40
00:15:08,815 --> 00:15:13,240
Motion capture 3 and 8.

41
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,275
Shit.

42
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:55,560
Mr. Oscar, we'll be a few linmutes late.

43
00:26:55,845 --> 00:26:56,705
Okay.

44
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,270
Should I let the Agency know?

45
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,565
Don't bother.

46
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,660
I'll try and make up some time.

47
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,105
Speed things up at this appointment

48
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,075
so we're in time for the next ones.

49
00:27:15,325 --> 00:27:16,490
Céline?

50
00:27:16,545 --> 00:27:19,150
No appointment in the forest this week?

51
00:27:20,535 --> 00:27:22,730
Not this week, Mr. Oscar.

52
00:27:24,085 --> 00:27:25,255
Too bad.

53
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,560
I miss forests.

54
00:31:54,645 --> 00:31:56,075
Keep back!

55
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:35,730
Hello.

56
00:32:36,075 --> 00:32:37,420
I'm Jamie,

57
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,430
photographer
Harry T-Bone's assistant.

58
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,410
Do you speak French?

59
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,865
Well,

60
00:32:45,935 --> 00:32:48,645
we're doing a shoot for Wave magazine

61
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,095
with Kay M the top model.

62
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,625
Heard of her?

63
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,785
Harry thinks it'd be great

64
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,780
to shoot you together.

65
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,255
A shot that's kind of "strange"...

66
00:33:03,575 --> 00:33:05,945
A bit "Beauty and the Beast."

67
00:33:06,105 --> 00:33:07,155
You see?

68
00:33:09,975 --> 00:33:12,530
Do you know Diane Arbus, for example?

69
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,470
A great American photographer.

70
00:33:15,745 --> 00:33:17,785
She took photos of dwarves,

71
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,715
giants, monsters...

72
00:33:19,775 --> 00:33:21,925
Photos that are really "human."

73
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,545
-Hi, dad.
-Hi, sweetie.

74
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:09,530
Got glitter on you?

75
00:45:10,135 --> 00:45:12,120
Aren't we taking a friend home?

76
00:45:12,675 --> 00:45:14,385
Yes. Sonia.

77
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:16,045
But she got her mom

78
00:45:16,135 --> 00:45:17,650
to fetch her an hour ago.

79
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:19,290
She was bored

80
00:45:19,495 --> 00:45:20,695
Poor Sonia.

81
00:45:20,965 --> 00:45:23,005
She's usually so easy-going.

82
00:45:27,165 --> 00:45:28,370
Look in the glove box.

83
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,395
Might be something for you.

84
00:45:32,635 --> 00:45:33,735
A cream puff!

85
00:45:35,965 --> 00:45:38,105
Did you have a good time, my Angèle?

86
00:45:38,715 --> 00:45:39,910
Yes, I did!

87
00:45:40,485 --> 00:45:41,580
Well, how was it?

88
00:45:42,825 --> 00:45:44,050
I don't know...

89
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,715
Just really good.

90
00:45:46,135 --> 00:45:49,110
We stayed in Paris for your first party

91
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:50,850
so tell me how it went.

92
00:45:53,965 --> 00:45:55,790
You look beat, Dad.

93
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,945
Yeah, appointments all day long.

94
00:45:57,985 --> 00:45:59,290
One after the other.

95
00:46:00,465 --> 00:46:02,755
So, did you dance?

96
00:46:02,945 --> 00:46:03,965
Of course.

97
00:46:04,265 --> 00:46:06,000
Yeah? Who with?

98
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,370
Oh, you don't know them.

99
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:11,485
Vincent, Tiago, Max...

100
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,925
You'll soon forget your old dad

101
00:46:15,935 --> 00:46:17,980
for some overgrown jerk.

102
00:46:18,925 --> 00:46:20,175
Stop it!

103
00:46:31,695 --> 00:46:33,235
My little sprout,

104
00:46:34,205 --> 00:46:35,875
growing up...

105
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:47,415
Who was that?

106
00:46:47,655 --> 00:46:48,860
Don't know.

107
00:46:48,885 --> 00:46:50,785
Probably a boy from the party.

108
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:52,650
Here we go.

109
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,640
Oh, Sonia.

110
00:47:03,675 --> 00:47:04,985
It's your friend.

111
00:47:06,155 --> 00:47:07,460
Aren't you at home?

112
00:47:08,885 --> 00:47:10,405
Did you just ring her?

113
00:47:10,815 --> 00:47:12,860
She's fine, she's with me. 

114
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,530
Your mom's fetching you? Good.

115
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:18,985
Bye Sonia.

116
00:47:36,175 --> 00:47:37,960
Why did you lie to me?

117
00:47:38,535 --> 00:47:39,850
What about?

118
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,275
The party,

119
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:42,965
Sonia being "bored"... everything.

120
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,340
I don't get it.

121
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,165
Why did you lie to me?

122
00:47:47,145 --> 00:47:48,675
I don't know.

123
00:47:50,985 --> 00:47:52,805
Nothing you told me was true?

124
00:47:54,945 --> 00:47:57,060
None of those boys were real?

125
00:47:57,105 --> 00:47:58,555
Angèle, look at me.

126
00:47:58,765 --> 00:48:00,405
I want the truth.

127
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:02,960
What really happened at the party?

128
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:06,465
I hid in the bathroom, that what.

129
00:48:08,705 --> 00:48:10,825
What, for hell's sake, why?

130
00:48:13,415 --> 00:48:15,280
Didn't know what else to do.

131
00:48:15,645 --> 00:48:17,935
Why didn't you ask me to pick you up?

132
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:21,215
Out of pride.

133
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:24,450
Pride? Skulking in the john?

134
00:48:25,105 --> 00:48:27,320
Your friend Sonia was the one dancing

135
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,400
with Max, Tiago and...

136
00:48:29,675 --> 00:48:31,665
-Right?
-Yes.

137
00:48:31,835 --> 00:48:33,790
She danced and you...

138
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:35,380
Why, for fuck's sake?

139
00:48:36,985 --> 00:48:38,830
She's popular, I'm not.

140
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:40,530
Don't be such a moron!

141
00:48:40,805 --> 00:48:42,535
How could you be popular,

142
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:43,910
hiding like that?

143
00:48:44,975 --> 00:48:46,620
I'm just not attractive.

144
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:48,000
Stop it!

145
00:48:49,655 --> 00:48:51,735
You'll be attractive all right.

146
00:48:52,295 --> 00:48:53,790
Like your mother.

147
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:55,985
People say I take after you.

148
00:48:56,025 --> 00:48:57,495
"Not attractive."

149
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:00,030
Who put that into your head?

150
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:03,120
Boys don't like me.

151
00:49:05,645 --> 00:49:07,375
Because you're not...

152
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:11,185
easy-going enough, probably.

153
00:49:12,005 --> 00:49:14,960
Why can't you be more easy-going,
like Sonia?

154
00:49:19,255 --> 00:49:21,550
You realize I'll have to punish you?

155
00:49:25,915 --> 00:49:27,645
Are you sorry you lied to me?

156
00:49:31,915 --> 00:49:33,945
I can't even tell if you're sincere.

157
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:35,710
Look at me!

158
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:40,985
If you were sure I wouldn't find out
would you lie again?

159
00:49:43,155 --> 00:49:44,610
I think so.

160
00:49:44,955 --> 00:49:46,405
Tell me why.

161
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:53,000
We'd both be happier right now, Dad.

162
00:50:24,465 --> 00:50:26,665
You've let me down, Angèle.

163
00:50:27,505 --> 00:50:28,735
Very badly.

164
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:32,645
Go on, get out.

165
00:50:32,945 --> 00:50:34,655
Go home.

166
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,500
What about you?

167
00:50:36,795 --> 00:50:39,950
Me? I'm going for a drive.

168
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,445
I'll be punished?

169
00:50:46,405 --> 00:50:48,445
Your punishment, my poor Angèle,

170
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:50,670
is to be you.

171
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,900
To have to live with yourself.

172
00:50:54,655 --> 00:50:56,565
Now get out, please.

173
00:55:09,905 --> 00:55:12,250
YOUR VICTIM

174
00:55:14,995 --> 00:55:16,905
YOUR WEAPON

175
00:57:19,695 --> 00:57:23,130
- Hi, Alex.
- Hi, Madame Ling.

176
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,110
I've come to see Théo.

177
00:57:28,485 --> 00:57:30,935
Everyone better get outta here.

178
00:58:11,415 --> 00:58:13,100
It was an accident, Alex.

179
00:58:14,955 --> 00:58:16,975
You know I didn't do it deliberately.

180
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:21,815
You should've deliberately not done it.

181
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:24,940
I think...

182
01:02:23,035 --> 01:02:24,800
Good evening, Oscar.

183
01:02:29,235 --> 01:02:30,340
Good evening.

184
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:37,625
You did a good job tonight.

185
01:02:39,335 --> 01:02:40,735
But?

186
01:02:40,875 --> 01:02:42,875
If you're here, there's a "but."

187
01:02:43,415 --> 01:02:45,000
But tell me this.

188
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,485
Do you still enjoy your work?

189
01:02:48,395 --> 01:02:50,480
I'm asking because some of us think

190
01:02:50,515 --> 01:02:52,325
you've looked a bit

191
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,170
tired recently.

192
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:02,210
Some don't believe
in what they're watching anymore.

193
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,450
I miss the cameras.

194
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,645
They used to be heavier than us.

195
01:03:10,725 --> 01:03:13,120
Then they became smaller than our heads.

196
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:16,170
Now you can't see them at all.

197
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:19,500
So sometimes I too find it hard
to believe in it all.

198
01:03:20,005 --> 01:03:22,840
Isn't this nostalgia a bit senitmental?

199
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,010
Thugs don't need to see

200
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:30,565
the security cameras

201
01:03:30,655 --> 01:03:33,105
to believe in them.

202
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:36,440
Trying to make us all paranoid?

203
01:03:36,775 --> 01:03:37,930
Aren't you already?

204
01:03:38,385 --> 01:03:40,280
I am. Very.

205
01:03:40,855 --> 01:03:42,865
For instance, I've always been sure

206
01:03:42,925 --> 01:03:44,240
I'd die some day.

207
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:46,880
What is it you want?

208
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:49,860
Nothing. You know I like your work.

209
01:03:50,485 --> 01:03:51,910
But some of us...

210
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,945
Who the hell are you talking about?

211
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:56,375
Let me ask the questions!

212
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:02,510
What makes you carry on, Oscar?

213
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,480
What made me start:

214
01:04:06,290 --> 01:04:08,135
the beauty of the act.

215
01:04:10,675 --> 01:04:11,980
Beauty?

216
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:14,580
They say it's in the eye,

217
01:04:15,005 --> 01:04:17,365
the eye of the beholder.

218
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:21,830
And if there's no more beholder?

219
01:04:36,055 --> 01:04:38,020
Are you okay, Mr. Oscar?

220
01:04:39,215 --> 01:04:40,990
Oh, Céline...

221
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,940
Some days one murder is not enough.

222
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:45,540
Monsieur!

223
01:04:52,865 --> 01:04:56,495
Do you want dinner before or
after your next appointment?

224
01:04:56,580 --> 01:04:58,175
Later, thank you.

225
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:07,620
Look how beautiful Paris is tonight!

226
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:34,525
He was greatly in love with you.

227
01:05:37,550 --> 01:05:39,000
You don't hurt me.

228
01:05:39,505 --> 01:05:41,120
You make me very happy.

229
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:42,970
You don't hurt...

230
01:05:46,355 --> 01:05:48,615
Céline, stop the car please!

231
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:49,910
Right now!

232
01:05:49,935 --> 01:05:51,715
What's going on, Mr. Oscar?

233
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:21,685
Whre is he?

234
01:06:26,225 --> 01:06:27,640
Hey, banker!

235
01:06:29,305 --> 01:06:30,675
Now it is done.

236
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,630
Aim for the crotch!

237
01:06:47,485 --> 01:06:48,775
Excuse me.

238
01:06:48,805 --> 01:06:50,910
Let me through please!

239
01:06:56,825 --> 01:06:58,160
Mr. Oscar...

240
01:06:58,890 --> 01:07:01,510
Mr. Oscar, come on. We'll be late.

241
01:07:04,055 --> 01:07:06,605
Forgive him, there's been a mix-up.

242
01:07:52,325 --> 01:07:54,055
Good evening, Mr. Vogan.

243
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,695
Good evening, Mr. Vogan.

244
01:10:09,450 --> 01:10:12,385
I forbid you to lie!

245
01:10:17,235 --> 01:10:20,215
You should've
deliberately not done it, Théo.

246
01:10:22,615 --> 01:10:24,930
I am alone.

247
01:10:26,685 --> 01:10:28,875
and they are everybody.

248
01:10:32,005 --> 01:10:34,500
I have a plan,

249
01:10:35,285 --> 01:10:39,050
to go mad.

250
01:13:20,465 --> 01:13:22,445
Ah, you're really here.

251
01:13:22,795 --> 01:13:24,235
Don't say anything.

252
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:26,385
I think I feel better.

253
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:27,755
Don't tire yourself.

254
01:13:29,385 --> 01:13:32,350
What does it matter if I'm tired now?

255
01:13:33,295 --> 01:13:35,260
There's no harm in making an effort

256
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,300
when it's the very last.

257
01:13:38,305 --> 01:13:41,735
Don't people always feel better
just before the end?

258
01:13:42,415 --> 01:13:44,080
I've often heard that.

259
01:13:46,025 --> 01:13:48,755
I was afraid you'd get tired of waiting.

260
01:13:50,610 --> 01:13:52,745
I've been waiting for three days.

261
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:54,320
You had a fever.

262
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:56,590
I would've waited far longer.

263
01:13:57,610 --> 01:13:59,295
I thought you would come

264
01:14:00,445 --> 01:14:01,950
but I wasn't sure.

265
01:14:02,385 --> 01:14:04,835
Such a long journey, Léa.

266
01:14:06,015 --> 01:14:07,150
Léa...

267
01:14:08,005 --> 01:14:10,490
You've been like an angel by my bed.

268
01:14:11,245 --> 01:14:14,360
You know, they talk about
the angel of death,

269
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:17,445
the most beautiful of all.

270
01:14:18,310 --> 01:14:19,960
You've been like that.

271
01:14:20,325 --> 01:14:22,290
As if you were waiting for me.

272
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:25,050
I wasn't waiting for your death.

273
01:14:25,425 --> 01:14:27,415
I was waiting for this moment together.

274
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:30,245
This is not death, dear uncle.

275
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:33,455
Not for you, no.

276
01:14:34,035 --> 01:14:37,025
Nothing makes us feel so alive
as to see others die.

277
01:14:37,410 --> 01:14:39,400
That's the sensation of life,

278
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:42,475
the feeling that we remain.

279
01:14:48,495 --> 01:14:50,965
What you have been to me!

280
01:14:52,575 --> 01:14:54,655
What you did for me!

281
01:14:55,490 --> 01:14:57,840
You did somethine once.

282
01:14:57,950 --> 01:14:59,390
You know that.

283
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:01,780
You've been everything to me!

284
01:15:03,715 --> 01:15:06,425
I would die myself not to lose you.

285
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:08,200
You won't lose me.

286
01:15:08,745 --> 01:15:10,590
You'll keep me.

287
01:15:11,395 --> 01:15:13,340
Life is better, Léa,

288
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:15,990
for in life there is love.

289
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:19,865
Death is good, but there's no love.

290
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,380
So is it true?

291
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:26,080
That you made me rich?

292
01:15:26,225 --> 01:15:27,990
That all I have is from you?

293
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:30,320
Don't speak of that.

294
01:15:30,335 --> 01:15:32,265
It wasn't a happy decision.

295
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:35,560
I believe I ruined you instead!

296
01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:38,595
He married me for my money, yes...

297
01:15:38,650 --> 01:15:39,985
He was greatly in love with you.

298
01:15:40,455 --> 01:15:44,175
Yes, but he wouldn't have married me
had I been poor.

299
01:15:44,285 --> 01:15:47,880
I don't want to hurt you,
I just want you to understand.

300
01:15:48,285 --> 01:15:50,015
I always understood.

301
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:53,715
You don't hurt me.

302
01:15:55,445 --> 01:15:57,155
You make me very happy.

303
01:15:58,955 --> 01:16:01,240
You wanted to look at life for yourself,

304
01:16:01,285 --> 01:16:03,035
but you were not allowed to.

305
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:05,325
You were punished for your wish.

306
01:16:05,910 --> 01:16:08,415
Yes, I've been punished.

307
01:16:10,285 --> 01:16:13,060
But I don't want to know or think.

308
01:16:13,215 --> 01:16:16,765
Just to be with you is enough for now.

309
01:16:18,170 --> 01:16:20,210
And I want you to be happy,

310
01:16:20,825 --> 01:16:22,995
not to think of anything sad.

311
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:26,695
Only to feel that I am near you
and that I love you.

312
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:30,580
Why should there be pain?

313
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,265
In such hours as these
what have we to do with pain?

314
01:16:37,785 --> 01:16:40,180
That's not the deepest thing.

315
01:16:43,505 --> 01:16:45,630
There is something deeper.

316
01:16:47,495 --> 01:16:49,920
That's not the deepest thing, no.

317
01:16:51,535 --> 01:16:55,060
But still it is very, very deep.

318
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,820
I don't know
why we must suffer so much.

319
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:03,725
Perhaps I shall find out soon.

320
01:17:04,885 --> 01:17:06,990
There are many things in life.

321
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:09,285
You're very young.

322
01:17:09,310 --> 01:17:11,360
I feel very old.

323
01:17:11,505 --> 01:17:15,045
You'll grow young again. That's
how I see you.

324
01:17:16,785 --> 01:17:18,545
I don't believe...

325
01:17:19,785 --> 01:17:21,295
No need for words now.

326
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:22,860
I don't believe

327
01:17:23,685 --> 01:17:26,025
that a mistake as generous as yours

328
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,415
can hurt you for long.

329
01:17:28,795 --> 01:17:30,790
I'm very happy now!

330
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:35,070
And remember that if you've been hated,

331
01:17:37,465 --> 01:17:40,410
you've also been loved, Léa.

332
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:45,540
Adored!

333
01:18:15,825 --> 01:18:17,030
Excuse me.

334
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:15,660
I've another appointment.

335
01:19:17,395 --> 01:19:18,650
Of course.

336
01:19:19,505 --> 01:19:22,070
I've got another appointment, too.

337
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:24,825
See you again, I hope.

338
01:19:26,825 --> 01:19:28,325
I hope so, too.

339
01:19:38,125 --> 01:19:39,625
What's your name?

340
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:41,170
Élise.

341
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:43,685
Thank you, Élise.

342
01:20:24,125 --> 01:20:25,185
Céline?

343
01:20:25,910 --> 01:20:27,435
This'll be my last appointment?

344
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:30,705
Yes, last one for today, Mr. Oscar.

345
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:45,530
Still not hungry?

346
01:20:55,335 --> 01:20:56,615
You're ill.

347
01:20:57,795 --> 01:21:00,180
I think I caught a cold
killing the banker.

348
01:21:00,510 --> 01:21:02,100
I'll switch the fire on.

349
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,570
What an idiot!

350
01:22:30,710 --> 01:22:32,180
Ectoplasm on wheels!

351
01:22:36,610 --> 01:22:38,430
I'm sorry, Mr. Oscar.

352
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:51,320
I was asleep...

353
01:23:53,495 --> 01:23:54,955
It's you?

354
01:23:56,745 --> 01:23:58,125
I think so.

355
01:24:07,305 --> 01:24:08,925
I've got 30 minutes.

356
01:24:11,330 --> 01:24:13,155
Have you got 30 minutes?

357
01:24:18,670 --> 01:24:20,880
I've got 30 minutes.

358
01:24:30,450 --> 01:24:32,365
Come with me then.

359
01:24:42,450 --> 01:24:45,800
I thought you'd quit working long ago.

360
01:24:47,810 --> 01:24:49,340
You disappeared.

361
01:24:51,470 --> 01:24:53,860
No, I never really disappeared.

362
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,080
Is that your hair?

363
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:03,645
No, not yet.

364
01:25:04,525 --> 01:25:06,110
They made me older.

365
01:25:08,625 --> 01:25:10,155
Are those your eyes?

366
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,225
They're Eva's eyes.

367
01:25:15,125 --> 01:25:16,470
Eva Grace.

368
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:20,935
An air hostess living her
last night tonight.

369
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:41,160
Good evening, Miss.

370
01:25:42,235 --> 01:25:43,250
Come.

371
01:26:19,415 --> 01:26:21,060
They gutted it.

372
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:23,955
They're turning it into a luxury hotel.

373
01:26:29,650 --> 01:26:31,185
I'll leave you, Miss.

374
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:49,820
I came here once to buy some bras.

375
01:26:52,035 --> 01:26:54,700
You were always so kind to me.

376
01:26:55,860 --> 01:26:57,625
But say no more.

377
01:26:58,695 --> 01:27:00,695
I won't speak either.

378
01:27:03,990 --> 01:27:06,585
My partner will be here in 20 minutes.

379
01:27:08,150 --> 01:27:10,275
We have 20 minutes to catch up on

380
01:27:11,425 --> 01:27:12,795
20 years.

381
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:16,820
Take my hand.

382
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:20,030
Let's walk.

383
01:27:27,235 --> 01:27:28,665
Most likely

384
01:27:28,885 --> 01:27:30,900
we'll never see each other again.

385
01:27:39,450 --> 01:27:41,360
20 minutes.

386
01:32:52,455 --> 01:32:53,685
Jean,

387
01:32:55,175 --> 01:32:57,020
there's something you don't know.

388
01:32:58,520 --> 01:32:59,745
About you?

389
01:33:01,905 --> 01:33:03,120
About us.

390
01:33:18,435 --> 01:33:20,650
Yes, time is against us.

391
01:33:21,055 --> 01:33:22,110
I'll be going.

392
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:26,060
Yes. He'll be here soon.

393
01:33:27,785 --> 01:33:29,795
It's better he and I don't meet.

394
01:38:09,425 --> 01:38:10,550
Mr. Oscar,

395
01:38:11,265 --> 01:38:13,555
you're drinking
and smoking God knows what.

396
01:38:13,945 --> 01:38:16,080
You really must eat something!

397
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:50,250
It's nearly midnight.

398
01:38:51,635 --> 01:38:52,945
Midnight?

399
01:38:53,805 --> 01:38:55,145
Céline,

400
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:58,935
we have to laugh before midnight.

401
01:39:00,195 --> 01:39:02,655
We'll do our best, Mr. Oscar.

402
01:39:03,990 --> 01:39:06,600
Who knows if we'll laugh
in the next life?

403
01:39:10,590 --> 01:39:12,170
Everything okay up front?

404
01:39:14,425 --> 01:39:17,540
Been a long day, hasn't it? Nearly over.

405
01:39:18,475 --> 01:39:20,435
How about you back there?

406
01:39:22,370 --> 01:39:26,060
We're having a ball
in the back of beyond.

407
01:39:26,990 --> 01:39:28,625
We're all drunk...

408
01:39:29,240 --> 01:39:30,765
Dead and drunk.

409
01:39:33,335 --> 01:39:35,170
Come and join us, Céline.

410
01:39:36,850 --> 01:39:38,630
We could dance.

411
01:39:40,435 --> 01:39:41,935
A slow dance?

412
01:39:42,235 --> 01:39:45,225
Maybe some other evening, Mr. Oscar.

413
01:39:51,270 --> 01:39:54,435
You know, I was a dancer once.

414
01:39:54,820 --> 01:39:55,960
Once?

415
01:39:57,135 --> 01:39:58,670
No, I didn't know.

416
01:39:59,825 --> 01:40:01,400
Are there any pictures?

417
01:40:02,810 --> 01:40:04,350
I don't think so.

418
01:40:05,125 --> 01:40:06,320
A dancer...

419
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:08,780
That must be wonderful.

420
01:40:19,875 --> 01:40:22,115
Quick, taxi! Follow that pigeon!

421
01:40:44,445 --> 01:40:46,100
It's getting late.

422
01:40:46,550 --> 01:40:49,360
You should get ready
for your last appointment.

423
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:28,225
YOUR HOUSE

424
01:41:30,235 --> 01:41:32,240
YOUR WIFE
YOUR DAUGHTERS

425
01:42:34,695 --> 01:42:36,275
It's almost time.

426
01:43:03,610 --> 01:43:05,435
The money for today.

427
01:43:06,485 --> 01:43:08,530
The key for tonight.

428
01:43:10,435 --> 01:43:11,945
See you tomorrow, Mr. Oscar.

429
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,580
-Same time?
-Same time.

430
01:43:14,130 --> 01:43:15,670
Good night, Céline.

431
01:43:16,010 --> 01:43:17,870
Thanks for everything.

432
01:43:49,810 --> 01:43:51,895
We would like to

433
01:43:52,060 --> 01:43:54,695
Live again

434
01:43:58,110 --> 01:43:59,865
But that means

435
01:43:59,995 --> 01:44:02,200
We'd like to relive

436
01:44:06,710 --> 01:44:09,400
the same thing

437
01:44:20,675 --> 01:44:25,165
Make the long journey once more

438
01:44:26,630 --> 01:44:30,200
Touch the point of no return

439
01:44:32,850 --> 01:44:36,150
And feel so very far away

440
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:39,860
from our childhood days

441
01:44:41,650 --> 01:44:44,810
And when we're cold, when we cry

442
01:44:45,665 --> 01:44:47,535
Even then we think

443
01:44:48,165 --> 01:44:51,775
That by heaven's leave we'd like to

444
01:44:54,890 --> 01:44:58,045
Live again

445
01:45:00,665 --> 01:45:02,610
That means

446
01:45:03,435 --> 01:45:05,320
We'd like to live

447
01:45:06,245 --> 01:45:08,450
the same thing afresh

448
01:45:10,735 --> 01:45:14,005
Our time has not yet come to rest

449
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:20,570
We have to do what we love again

450
01:45:22,465 --> 01:45:26,860
Dive once more into the cold liquid days

451
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:29,710
all the same

452
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:42,670
It's me!

453
01:46:29,770 --> 01:46:31,850
Live

454
01:46:32,710 --> 01:46:35,100
Relive...

455
01:46:45,225 --> 01:46:46,735
My dears, 

456
01:46:46,850 --> 01:46:49,240
I've got some very good news for us

457
01:46:50,310 --> 01:46:52,860
Our life's about to change.

458
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:02,085
We see ourselves stand

459
01:47:03,020 --> 01:47:05,850
Start again, feel

460
01:47:07,030 --> 01:47:10,250
the sap rise inside us

461
01:47:11,860 --> 01:47:14,560
But it cannot be

462
01:47:15,245 --> 01:47:17,455
No, it cannot be

463
01:47:17,620 --> 01:47:20,045
No, it cannot...

464
01:48:56,570 --> 01:48:58,320
I'm coming home.

465
01:49:44,250 --> 01:49:47,310
As sharp as ever, Miss 3423-AC-92!

466
01:49:58,975 --> 01:50:02,250
You'll soon have loads of time to sleep!

467
01:50:03,405 --> 01:50:06,955
Won't be long till they send us
to the junkyard.

468
01:50:07,310 --> 01:50:08,900
We're becoming...inadequate.

469
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:10,650
In-what?

470
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:16,345
Quiet!

471
01:50:17,060 --> 01:50:20,060
Old 5700-BC-78 is speaking the truth.

472
01:50:20,985 --> 01:50:23,115
Men don't want
visible machines anymore.

473
01:50:23,200 --> 01:50:27,060
Yes, don't want no more engines,

474
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:30,390
no more action.

475
01:51:20,410 --> 01:51:23,300
Katya - for you
