Your book gives me tremendous hope

00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,170
Although my body is not good, 
though...

32
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,120
I make them subject to a lot of pain

33
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,480
Perhaps someday, the kids will love me

34
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,270
Thank you - thank you.

35
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,380
To the end here.

00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,880
Guys, sorry, the book signing 
concluded.

have to sign

Quietly sign, no one will see

00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,620
Then sign a copy of my will collapse

00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,360
Really disappointed that I can from 
afar

46
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,900
I have to go? I'm tired.

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,980
The exposed surface can go.

48
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,150
But I'm tired - very soon.

49
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,100
All for you Oh, I'm not going to be a 
long time

You're already here! - Karina

00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,140
Not.

59
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,610
Hello

60
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,110
Hello - Hello?

61
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,080
De Wigan, so glad to see you again.

62
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,840
Don't you remember me? - Huh?

63
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,560
Brown multi Fellini, your Italian 
Publisher

64
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,430
Thanks for letting me publishing this 
book, a giant!

65
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,970
Thrilling you!

66
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,090
See I'm all cried out

67
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,350
But I think the sales results will 
not make us cry

68
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,000
I would like to ask you...

69
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,050
Just I'm sorry.

70
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,900
I don't blame you

71
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,110
This book is for me very difficult

72
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,640
I know

73
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,180
Glad to meet you

74
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,740
I really appreciate your work

75
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,240
Sometimes I have a

76
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,990
You are special to me and writing feel

77
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,910
Like you see my thoughts

78
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,990
You have the book?

79
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,170
Of course there are

80
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,920
To sign to who?

81
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,100
Ella - she

82
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,790
Yeah, like the market name, My name 
is Ella

83
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,390
Thank you

84
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,170
Would you like a Cup of vodka?

85
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,530
Why not?

86
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,270
I want to know how you work

87
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,240
You are writing notes or recording?

88
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,520
Write notes

89
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,960
I have several Notebook

90
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,970
Ready to take on the body

91
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,280
've been with?

92
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,660
Yeah, so I'm more at ease

93
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,480
I can look at?

94
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,180
See?

95
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,210
Don't worry, I won't steal the turn

96
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,930
A total of 4 present

97
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,260
1 of the present recording...is 
writing the book

98
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,410
2 This is used to...remember the 
title, ideas

99
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,290
This is it, write more intimate things

100
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,300
Now you are probably not easy?

101
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:29,030
Achievements, reviews, family reaction

102
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,730
Like a sudden lay of the spotlight

103
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,020
I think you almost can't go on.

104
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,320
Can't go?

105
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,460
A bit of an exaggeration.

106
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,430
However, you occasionally will feel 
very alone.

107
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,500
Feed - ready?

108
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,420
No, like I've been hollowed out.

109
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,860
The country can make you a good rest

110
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,160
Banquet?

111
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,430
You didn't come to the

112
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,940
You over there?

113
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,160
I spoke to sue Miller co-chaired the 
Europe hereby will meet

114
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,720
After the meeting there is a queue, 
do not go open

115
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,280
Later find the opportunity to first 
slip.

116
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,450
I met a woman, very interesting

117
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,940
Ah, change for a woman interested?

118
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,830
Don't be ridiculous.

119
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,920
We talked all night, great

120
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,530
Her ability to listen first class

121
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,000
Listen attentively

122
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,430
Willing to listen to not many people.

123
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,470
What's her name?

124
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,460
Ella

125
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:08,930
Yeah, is she, what's her name?

126
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,500
I tell you La, El Le

127
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,160
Her name is Ella on? - The

128
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,730
Just like the vegetable market in the 
name

129
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,380
Excuse me

130
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,820
How is it, Raymond

131
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:32,850
I saw your car

132
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,280
You want some coffee?

133
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,250
No thanks...just take two bottles of 
cider over

134
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,810
Really

135
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,280
You really are too kind!

136
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,690
Awesome

137
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,120
I bought a Delphine wrote the book

138
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,380
If you can please her signature.

139
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,920
Sorry, I should sent a present to you

140
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,050
Take

141
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,780
A few years ago...

142
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,660
My wife also spent a period of hard 
times

143
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,020
She is also fed into

144
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,640
It's a bit like talking about her 
story

145
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,500
She didn't commit suicide?

146
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,290
No, thankfully

147
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,430
Now she is completely well

148
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:14,880
Thank you

149
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,660
Then...leave.

150
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,290
Not much to be?

151
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,410
Not

152
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,110
Wish smoothly - Thank you.

153
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,100
Now the kids are gone...

154
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,180
I want them

155
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,010
Of course you will want them, but...

156
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,730
More unencumbered.

157
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,200
More unencumbered to come here?

158
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,700
To, is also.

159
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,360
But I mean the writing, a few months.

160
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,730
What you even read didn't do, the 
light"gathering information"

161
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,910
Is the start of work, isn't it?

162
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,210
The collection of information does 
not work?

163
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,580
I know you

164
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,500
How much of this will take some time

165
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,100
But this time you have been hesitant 
not before

166
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,160
This is a big challenge, a new 
adventure

167
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,040
Those roles, I have to tell them to 
get along...

168
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,860
I don't know...maybe two years

169
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,850
This is normal

170
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:58,870
What is normal?

171
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,490
Is the thinking, questioning.

172
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,970
I really want to write? They really 
so funny?

173
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,170
In the unlikely event I'm wrong?

174
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,540
This kind of thing, you know?

175
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,530
Do you think that you're mistaken?

176
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,510
Not, not so

177
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,220
I'm ready

178
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,640
Also very happy to be once again 
buried the first work

179
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:33,050
"You think just say it's a novel."

180
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,770
"Then change a few names will be able 
to get away with it"

181
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,480
"You can continue to live your 
apathetic day?"

182
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,980
"Too late."

183
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,760
"You betrayed your mother earn a lot 
of money"

184
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,830
"The home idea show, the reward is 
very high."

185
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,530
"Purse full Oh"

186
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,250
"To continue to make big money."

187
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,940
Hello - Hello, I'm Ella

188
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,540
Such a hit to some venture

189
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,190
I don't know if the so fast to call 
you

190
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,820
I gave you my phone number?

191
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:21,130
Yes, but you maybe just out of 
courtesy

192
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,060
You have...out for a Cup of coffee?

193
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,660
Yeah, why not?

194
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,050
Sorry, you must have better things to 
do

195
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,680
On the contrary, I am glad that you 
about me

196
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,150
Hello - Hello

197
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,390
Stil, a glass of white wine for?

198
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,450
Yes, Thank you.

199
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,040
That day both I in speaking, didn't 
talk to you

200
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,740
I have nothing to say.

201
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,990
I'm interested in

202
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,490
But don't want to say it doesn't 
matter

203
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:50,900
Thank you

204
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,680
I help others to write autobiography

205
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,190
Write someone else's life in exchange 
for remuneration

206
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,910
Actress, female politicians...

207
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,880
Is written by you, the author, but 
hang their name

208
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,540
I belong to the circle of unseen kind 
of person

209
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,820
Stars beneath the shadow of the

210
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,270
So you pick the...customer.

211
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,090
You refers to my patients.

212
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,810
Well, now your patient is who?

213
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,180
A TV presenter

214
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,620
Summer in her home, recorded 30 hours 
of interviews

215
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,500
Now trying to write a book

216
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:31,270
You've never thought about writing 
yourself?

217
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,090
Yourself?

218
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,530
Of your own life.

219
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,860
My life nothing to say

220
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,640
My husband has long since passed 
away, left me alone

221
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,110
Also no children

222
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,740
Is you choose not to?

223
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,950
Anyway, I also don't feel sorry

224
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,430
We do not live together, each have 
their own life

225
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,380
Between us is like that

226
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,060
I probably scared rigid, a compromise.

227
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,230
Afraid of people in love live 
together for a few years after

228
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,380
Into the kind of relationship

229
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,940
Everyone for your comments kind of 
relationship?

230
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,660
You meat search me?

231
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,900
Without the meat of the search, we 
all know

232
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,850
We all know that? - Yes

233
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,220
Know you with a bit of TV Arts 
reporter rapport

234
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,580
He invited you on the program is 
batch miserably

235
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,750
What, am I not allowed on his show?

236
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,660
Not, but would provoke jealousy, it's 
normal.

237
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,030
How is this considered normal

238
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,850
A lot of writers want to get invited

239
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:22,800
Even I was also

240
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,200
Damn, I forgot...I gotta go.

241
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,860
I talked to Editors about

242
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,750
Checkout, Thank you - good

243
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:33,580
You about where?

244
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:34,790
The 6th district

245
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,610
I just happened to stop by, and go 
together.

246
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,130
Your children have left home, right?

247
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,060
The

248
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,690
They leave me.

249
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,100
Son admitted to the Belgian Academy 
of Arts

250
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:58,130
Daughter wanted to test the National 
Civil Aviation school

251
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,420
Now in Lyon, a star of pre-school

252
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,340
Your daughter wanted to be a pilot?

253
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,030
Not

254
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,250
I at this station

255
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,000
Prayer

256
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,210
Damn, my notebook

257
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,160
Hello?

258
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,550
Of course I'm at home

259
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,110
Can you see me?

260
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:42,890
Really?

261
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,220
But where are you?

262
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,240
I didn't see you.

263
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,650
Incredible

264
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:57,310
When?

265
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,070
Saturday

266
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,780
I see I have no available

267
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,370
Anyway, Thank you

268
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,600
Good night - good night

269
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,040
Hello beautiful

270
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,260
I was the first one to?

271
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,080
I thought I was late.

272
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,110
No

273
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,220
By the way, Happy Birthday

274
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,060
I said what all don't take, don't the 
gifts and flowers

275
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,850
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

276
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,330
Forgive you.

277
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,490
I'll talk to the other open together

278
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,800
I can't believe

279
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,690
It took you two days to get these?

280
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,370
Really outrageous

281
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,870
Are you a family man?

282
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,550
He wanted me to think so, but I don't 
know.

283
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,950
You should have vaguely thought about 
who or suspect who?

284
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,130
No

285
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,010
Maybe this is your theme:"follow-up"

286
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,250
What follow-up do?

287
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:13,550
You on a book"follow-up"

288
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,370
The book revealed the story of the 
subsequent development

289
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,220
For several months I'm all in favor 
of a present

290
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,370
Completely fictional novel

291
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,750
Delphine...

292
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,080
Completely fictional novel, really?

293
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,970
Now, you have gone beyond these.

294
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,980
You should accept the reality.

295
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,930
They won't come, we two people to eat.

296
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,080
Wait a little longer - no.

297
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,580
Call and ask

298
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,050
No, hit is white hit

299
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,620
You exactly say to them?

300
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,010
No, my annual Unified e-mail 
notification

301
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,060
They followed in previous years did 
not come

302
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,140
The minimum to split a gift.

303
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,090
Glad you came

304
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,520
You don't know this about me more 
meaningful

305
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,200
Since my husband died.

306
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,660
His friends will no longer bother me.

307
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,570
Every year I invite, but they never 
did.

308
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,240
You know the reason?

309
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,890
I don't want to say, I'm not ready

310
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:57,930
Someday, I will tell you

311
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,360
This is my new book content summary

312
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,580
Look at

313
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,770
Also no one saw, I would like to hear 
your thoughts

314
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,210
My God, a sea of people

315
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,530
De·Wigan lady, you can come really 
good.

316
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,420
Thank you for inviting us - Hello

317
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,780
To, I have a surprise for you

318
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,710
Book on the photo is very small, and 
no plus box

319
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,740
She deserve to have a life-size 
portrait of

320
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,090
And is the body like

321
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,250
Sorry, I have to go and say Hello.

322
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,660
I'll be right back.

323
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,290
Hello

324
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,210
Here we go.

325
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:20,500
You don't mean Karina?

326
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:21,690
No, I have to go.

327
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:08,490
Hey - it's me

328
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,020
I Wake you up?

329
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,460
There is a little

330
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,950
I'm sorry it's so early to call fight 
you

331
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,350
I run into a big problem.

332
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,070
You have Voice Recorder?

333
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,290
There, there is a

334
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:24,570
I now can past get? Urgent

335
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,510
Got to go, need to teach you?

336
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:46,600
No, I have the same recorder

337
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,010
Early in the morning can look so 
perfect

338
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,350
What do you do? I just can't.

339
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,330
No, all women do

340
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,420
I don't think

341
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,060
How do you see with what others see 
are two different things

342
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,650
Today what?

343
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:04,950
Coffee Olay and jam bread, please.

344
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:09,490
Thank you, believe me, I carefully 
read the

345
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,040
It's just a background description, 
character not stereotypes

346
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,910
Good

347
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,690
But the story outline with the 
overall architecture of the forming

348
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,000
In short, some things need...

349
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,630
I was like - huh?

350
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,310
Really! - Thank you, this helps me a 
lot

351
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,780
I think in my back into creation 
before the

352
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:24,410
Will be successful

353
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,770
I really need an objective opinion - 
you coffee

354
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:29,530
Thank you

355
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,840
Last night I talked to a man in a 
hotel overnight

356
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,690
Early morning 5, 6, put on clothes

357
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,540
Take taxi home, to the downstairs.

358
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:40,970
Only to find forgot to take the key

359
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,060
Have a spare key?

360
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,200
There, but the maid 11 point only to

361
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:47,530
I talked to an official about a 
morning at the Congress meet

362
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,030
I want to write her autobiography

363
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,180
Interesting?

364
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,400
Super exciting

365
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,060
Hey, just kidding

366
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,070
Get out of here, I want to smoke.

367
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,630
You know, Delphine

368
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,730
I have to honestly tell you

369
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,270
You might think

370
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,930
Some harsh...

371
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,680
I just lied to you.

372
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,750
I think your story is boring

373
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,820
Not bad, but just uninteresting

374
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,420
This story with you not the slightest 
relationship

375
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,900
You're wrong, and shouldn't waste 
time on this

376
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,610
Just because you don't dare to write 
you the written

377
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,300
Of course...

378
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,620
If you get to edit the look, she 
would say great.

379
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,860
They're not stupid.

380
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,160
Have to rely on you for them to make 
money

381
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,490
Don't be fool, they only care about 
this

382
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,250
Even if you lower the writing was 
then rotten

383
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,230
They always have a way to get 
thousands of readers to pay

384
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,610
I in the morning departure, you alone 
I'm not too reassured

385
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:52,490
Are you sure you can?

386
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,120
I'm so much better

387
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:57,540
Ella helped me a lot busy

388
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:58,690
El?

389
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,510
Which aspect of it?

390
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,610
Can together to chat about work

391
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,650
Talk about important or relatively 
private.

392
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,880
Sometimes I feel like she makes your 
mind unstable

393
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,150
Not

394
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,270
Well

395
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,140
She is relatively persistent in some 
ideas

396
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,610
Although I am not agree

397
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,200
But can always bring out the Spark

398
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,960
Let me get clear on their beliefs

399
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,240
You see

400
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,510
She bought a new notebook and send me

401
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,310
I still do not trust

402
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,710
You could have written?

403
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,340
Haven't

404
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,160
But soon.

405
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,140
When did you come back?

406
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,130
I go to Texas, see McKinsey

407
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,370
Then to Los Angeles to find Ellis.

408
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,610
There are di flute Weng

409
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,070
You are really lucky to be invited to 
her, I love her work

410
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,450
Rest for a few days and then go to 
New York to see Delhi lo

411
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,800
A total of...

412
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,650
Three weeks

413
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,380
And then it's gone?

414
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,350
Also Mike Ethan Wang, he's in London

415
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,390
They planned to let me continue to do 
in the third quarter

416
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,720
But I rejected

417
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,950
I don't want to talk to you separate 
too long

418
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,480
"Really heavy"

419
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:18,430
"As your loved ones, the crown with 
the same last name"

420
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,090
"Today is particularly heavy"

421
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:23,350
"Are you for himself the surname of 
Were you trippin"

422
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,610
"Yes, I'm the writer of the 
relatives, I Bah"

423
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:29,740
"I heard that you get rid of your 
kids."

424
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:30,860
"Smart"

425
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,710
"In front of the obstacles are in 
addition to, right?"

426
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,270
"I know you're not a good mother."

427
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:38,150
Hey - I just got another e

428
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,460
Another seal?

429
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:41,060
Anonymous letter

430
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,490
Here again? Poor you!

431
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,920
You on Facebook? - Facebook for?

432
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,770
You don't see you on Facebook happen?

433
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,330
I can't book Ah, I don't know how on

434
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,110
This is very serious, to be with, I 
immediately went to the

00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,650
Well, I'm at home waiting for you

436
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:00,240
Facebook is going on? Maybe my page

437
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,770
But not my problem.

438
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,400
You didn't login, but there is one 
with your name on the account

439
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,630
Who are in the above post

440
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,580
What is the password for?

441
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,010
louisepaul222, all lowercase

442
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,320
Why is 222 for?

443
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,810
I don't know, not my set

444
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,270
You a loved ones to leave a message

445
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,500
A day in the denigrate you

446
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,290
Take a look at this

447
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,180
"She's dangerous, and is destroying 
everything the pervert."

448
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,160
"If you are like her family and 
friends"

449
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,980
"Be sure to like her mom as being 
locked up in the sanatorium"

450
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,330
Turn off it!

451
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,170
You are wrong, this is very serious

452
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:40,780
Anonymity is worse, on a social 
networking site of the attack worse

453
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:41,740
Is?

454
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,610
Users more gullible defamatory, does 
not consider the fact that

455
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,210
So the response is also useless

456
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,940
Your readers have for you defence.

457
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,760
Not all of it - not

458
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,280
And then they start to attack each 
other

459
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,690
Take a look at this

460
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:54,560
"Why are you so vicious"

461
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,500
"Hate her to just go read someone 
else's book!"

462
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:57,530
Another person a message

463
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,790
"All is shit, want to eat shit is her 
home."

464
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:03,540
"In order to be on TV nothing to say 
bitch."

465
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,680
"In order to be on the cover of a 
magazine what are willing to do"

466
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,050
"Look at her take on that man"

467
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,860
"She only has eyes for money, family 
can sell"

468
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,650
"Dare say, is literature"

469
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,170
Turn it off, please, don't say it 
again.

470
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,180
I'm sorry, but...it's too much

471
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,720
I'm tired

472
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:25,980
I know

473
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,020
Don't worry

474
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,870
Let me handle it.

475
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,420
Eat it, you will feel relaxed many

476
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:38,770
What is this?

477
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,870
Anti-anxiety medicine

478
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,500
0.5 mg ingot

479
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,570
Thank you

480
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,770
Night and then eat a

481
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,550
Okay?

482
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:32,790
Call

483
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,010
Sleep?

484
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,890
With yesterday the same, very secure

485
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:39,280
The middle of the night 4 point Wake 
Up very disturbed

486
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,650
Couldn't sleep

487
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,820
There and then eat a pill?

488
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:44,970
I swallowed two

489
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,130
8 point and a half to 9 points and 
barely slept for half an hour

490
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,380
louisepaul222, right?

491
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,360
How often do you confiscate the 
letter?

492
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,240
Well

493
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,470
From the reply begin

494
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,380
Uh...

495
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:10,900
For all of the planned solicitation, 
a column about the draft

496
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,370
And manuscript review

497
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,100
I'll just say you're busy with the 
new book creation

498
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,010
On offer you to feel pleasure

499
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,540
But at the moment you need to 
concentrate on

500
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,110
This answer can also?

501
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:24,550
And then to sentence polite rhetoric, 
like...

502
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,910
"Please keep in touch, the next time 
you absolutely duty-bound"

503
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,010
What is this? Durga city High School?

504
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,360
You promised next week to the past?

to do the report

506
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:39,420

00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,790
I promised to go to lectures, talking 
to writers stand

508
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:46,420
Speeches for?

509
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,660

510
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:56,650
Remember a few key points...a 3 Letter

From the school librarians, serious 
if the

00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,990
She said:"the students are glad you 
can be evacuated to"

513
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,970
"Can I send you take of the train 
schedule"

514
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,330
"As stated in my previous letter, I 
need it"

515
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:09,150
"To schedule the student's time and 
book the venue"

516
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,410
Later, she began to hurry.

517
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,910
She said:"due to the delay did not 
see your reply..."

518
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,930
"Remind you"

519
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,750
"Next Thursday there are 200 students 
waiting"

520
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:21,390
"Listen to your speech the writing 
stand to talk of"

521
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,870
"Thank you, they are poring over your 
work"

522
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,380
Really hate this woman

523
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,610
I don't know...this is how back with 
it, Delphine in?

524
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,730
Got a reply

525
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,100
I will go

526
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:36,960
Are you sure?

527
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,720
I have no choice

528
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:56,870
Your coffee

529
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,830
I find you as Durga city High School 
notes

530
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:04,770
In fact, by the time you throw in the 
trash.

531
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,670
Really?

532
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:08,380
No head no tail, I completely 
rewritten.

533
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,130
Do you want to see it?

534
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,520
Also the line?

535
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,570
Anything

536
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,990
You saved me

537
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,380
Can help on the busy, I'm happy

538
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:37,280
If we can let you focus on the 
important things just fine

539
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,830
You know I have troubles

540
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:50,170
In fact...

541
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,110
I rented the apartment

542
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:57,710
The landlord of the original 
overseas, but suddenly coming back.

543
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:59,020
I have to move out

544
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:06,220
Can I live your home a week or two?

545
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,910
Until I find a new house

546
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,430
I want to say child's room empty...

547
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:14,080
Of course you can

548
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:19,770
These you all need?

549
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:22,230
No, but I can't find a place to put

550
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:25,840
There is also documentation

551
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,470
No, Don't move too heavy.

552
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,070
An Elevator would be nice

553
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,630
We asked, but the real estate 
business is not Ken built

554
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:05,070
You can use these shelves, a closet, 
also empty.

555
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,970
I come back later to pack

556
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,370

I don't have anything to say to you?

00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:52,510
You want to talk about what topic

562
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,910
My first book

563
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,270
On working hard

564
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,220

I can open the window?

571
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,890
Received a bit of city noise

572
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:27,230
Of course you can - will feel lively 
some of the

573
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,070
You know the program of gist

574
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,850
Back view you a a novel

575
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,670
See how it affects now

576
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,160
Do you remember Emmanuel at first 
glance now of the moment?

577
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,810
I remember very clearly

578
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:43,150
I'm on the D-line Express.

579
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:45,550
The weather was bad, raining

580
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:47,660
I'm on my way to work

581
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:48,710
At the time the work is very dull

582
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,590
Through the novel to portray the 
workplace of the world

583
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,440
There are so easy?

584
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,740
The beginning theme is not in the 
workplace

585
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:59,390
But city of Solitude

586
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:03,710
I think from day to day the angle cut 
into the person's life

587
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,980
Broken, lonely life

588
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,340
There is nothing climax

589
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,670
Your work why is it dull?

590
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:14,510
I'm in the company responsible for 
social PR

591
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:19,150
To understand social relationships

592
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,500
To exclude communication barriers and 
conflict situations, to find solutions

593
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:26,110
I think you probably don't want to 
hear anymore.

594
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:32,380
Thank you please let

595
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,010

Thank you, goodbye - Thank you,

598
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,860
Bye - bye

599
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:43,920
How?

600
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,190
You make new friends?

601
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,730
To engage in such a out know where 
you go

602
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,940
"So you want to return to the fiction 
of the embrace?"

603
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:54,850
Fuck her what's the matter?

604
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,840
She has what qualifications?

605
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,080
Are you serious?

606
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,840
You're jealous?

607
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,430
Sorry, to see you for this waste of 
time I was angry

608
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,700
This woman will make you sink

609
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:07,290
Only I know you, know you can write 
what

610
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,380
Only you?

611
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:11,060
Can't you see I'm scared to death

612
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,310
Have come to a dead end?

613
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,670
Don't say that was a good book, 
listen to I'm sick of it

614
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,880
Said a non-stop, but even a shadow not

615
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,060
What contraindications, treasure, 
ban, all did not

616
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,240
Nothing, that's all.

617
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:23,050
Look at me, I'm empty, can penetrate 
the

618
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:39,290
This machine have ways of making you 
talk

619
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,780
Dear Paul, what is it?

620
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,340
Don't you love mom anymore?

621
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,380
Occasionally call me, I miss you

622
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:51,440
There are sister links, then, called 
her to also contact me

623
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,360
Love you

624
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,180
Take care of yourself, you know?

625
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,000
Mom?

626
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,500
Yes, mom.

627
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:08,000
Just remind your mom also in

628
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,020
Okay...

629
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,200
Before you call every day

630
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,540
I'm in school, mom.

631
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:13,940
I'm so excited

632
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:15,420
Just completed first solo flight

633
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,140
A single fly? What's that?

634
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:18,360
Is the instructor first to let go

635
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,110
Make your flying alone

636
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,330
At his command?

637
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,730
No, he's not on the plane

638
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,160
I am a man

639
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:28,170
This is what I've done the best thing.

640
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:30,860
You can't imagine, I'll tell you

641
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,420
Well...later then tell me

642
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,500
Then the next time you chat.

643
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,290
Love you

644
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:48,440
Back?

645
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,560
You have to go?

646
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,000
Yeah, I'm already late.

647
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,780
But still there is progress, then the 
big mess

648
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,980
When did you start not moving the pen?

649
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:58,130
Don't know, but that's it.

650
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,810
Don't worry, we'll face it together.

651
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,820
But your offer also so many

652
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,740
Works translated around the world

653
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,920
I told everyone you are not in Paris

654
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,590
You didn't say I can't write?

655
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:13,660
No, can't let people know your status

656
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,100
"The first is to betray your mother."

657
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:47,260
"And then hooked up with the literary 
program presenter promotions"

658
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,530
"Congratulations, admire"

659
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:51,930
"He dumped you, it can be expected a 
present"

660
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,450
"You're the best at 淫书 to be 
published."

661
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,790
"You hurt the people around you"

662
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,710
"Caused great damage"

663
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,990
"You know why?"

664
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:03,090
"Because people believe in the 
printed text"

665
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:18,170
Must be on your rancor long-awaited 
people

666
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:22,680
Your book Release This anger

667
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:29,490
This letter was recently received?

668
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:31,980
The

669
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,610
"People believe the printed word"

670
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,000
They are right

671
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:45,190
Why they're right?

672
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,020
"People"is who?

673
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,540
"People"might be wrong, might mess 
want

674
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:49,890
Look around you

675
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,540
Each of the writers in the writing 
community news events

676
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,880
Why is this?

677
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,440
Because that is the only reliable 
source

678
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,550
You want to turn back to writing 
fiction, there is only one reason

679
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,850
You refuse to write their own story

680
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,900
Don't take your sets to me.

681
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,630
Well, I apologize, but I insist to 
say down

682
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:07,250
I reread the journal in the scholarly 
world of that interview

683
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,910
Your Internet take a look at

684
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,470
Later I might write, but not now

685
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:13,380
I work with I went elsewhere

686
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,500
Go to where?

687
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:17,570
Take you away to where?

688
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:24,990
I see you're running in place

689
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,730
What Are you doing?

690
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,940
I heard you up

691
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:59,900
So?

692
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:04,120
If I make you uncomfortable, I can 
leave immediately

693
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,620
Sorry

694
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,080
I shouldn't speak

695
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:12,690
Are you okay, Delphine is?

696
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:14,670
Okay

697
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,450
You should sleep, tomorrow to get up 
early to go to Durga.

698
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:20,360
No, I can't.

699
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:24,550
I know the consequences very serious, 
but I can't go

700
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,310
I have no strength

701
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,290
You let me on your behalf?

702
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,540
Are you kidding me?

703
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:30,630
Not

704
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:33,180
You want to pretend to be into me?

705
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:34,300
?

706
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:37,720
The network has more than two 
thousand photo of me

707
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:40,820
Because of too many, each face are 
not the same

708
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,800
Are you serious?

709
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:45,910
Very seriously

710
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,260
Etc.

711
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:14,520
To try this

712
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,680
I'm on the D-line Express.

713
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:26,670
The weather was bad, raining

714
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:29,990
I rush to work, when work is dull

715
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:33,830
I'm in the company responsible for 
social and PR

716
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,830
To understand social relationships

717
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:42,550
To exclude communication barriers and 
conflict situations, to find solutions

718
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,520
I think you probably don't want to 
hear anymore.

719
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,660
Okay? I won't be too early to hit the

720
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:11,770
Not, okay

721
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,260
I woke up, just know a good news

722
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:16,220
What's the good news?

723
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,410
Al Roy for accepting our invitation

724
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:22,200
His French PR company also confirmed

725
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,180
Really happy for you.

726
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:28,490
What about you, okay?

727
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:30,220
I'm a little worried

728
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:31,630
Never got your message

729
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,000
I played two three times.

730
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:34,660
Also left a message for you

731
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:35,720
I'm okay.

732
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:39,750
Just?

733
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:41,250
Okay

734
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:46,430
I can understand your need to be 
alone, work to be confidential

735
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,270
So certain things, you don't want to 
tell me

736
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,350
But this time, you're a bit overdone

737
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,550
You push yourself to the danger.

738
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:57,810
Let me help you

739
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:59,660
Then come back

740
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,260
You know I can't.

741
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:05,230
We can't communicate, you tightly 
closed your

742
00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:07,300
We are not at War, I'm not your enemy

743
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:11,940
You know, sometimes

744
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,070
I can't help but to wonder if someone 
took control of you

745
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:16,670
Delphine is?

746
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,140
Europe Carrie Ann

747
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:23,100
Are you okay?

748
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:25,240
I'm sorry, I'm just a little 
attention has wandered just for

749
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,420
Well, I know

750
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,430
The hearts are placed in the 
authoring on the

751
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,770
Do you live nearby? - No, I live in 
Monte

752
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:32,750
We come here to the pediatric clinic 
to see

753
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,500
I promised my daughter after watching 
to sit on the carousel

754
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,870
Mom, you can go on the carousel? - Go

755
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,630
You go first, I'll be right over.

756
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:41,090
But can't sit alone Oh, the first 
next to see

757
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:44,450
You look at me but obediently listen 
to you.

758
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:47,170
Not visited, do not sign the book

759
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,600
Do not travel, activities all block 
off

760
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:50,560
Thank you, but I...

761
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,280
Don't say, but I have done it

762
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:54,260
Received your letter, I will not 
bother you.

763
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,700
Now I can't wait to read your new book

764
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,110
I'm sorry, what letter?

765
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,830
You send a letter to us before you 
finish the new book before the

766
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:02,510
Don't bother you.

767
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,040
Ah! I'm sorry, I...

768
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:07,820
Indeed, this time I retreat to 
concentrate on writing

769
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,710
I need to be alone, but...

770
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,070
Don't worry, I will soon be out off.

771
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:15,430
Well, I gotta go, come on.

772
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,140
How?

773
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:25,150
Super miserable

774
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:27,580
Is the librarian found out.

775
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:30,930
I went to the police station to 
forgery offences sent to the Office

776
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:33,970
Is currently on bail waiting pass

777
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:35,410
Okay, I talk nonsense.

778
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,880
Everything is going well

779
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:39,280
They simply have no doubt

780
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:48,070
You see, we can swap identities

781
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,380
I at any time pending disposal

782
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,650
Even if there is someone you know in, 
it will not goof

783
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,380
I can't wait to give it a try.

784
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,060
This is what you told me of a diary

785
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,430
You went through my stuff?

786
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,840
I didn't turn it in here

787
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:05,460
You record every thing, Super lucky

788
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,280
12-year-old started writing, has been 
to the children born

789
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:11,700
15 years of memories, events

790
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:13,580
Character sketches... - and 
adolescent gibberish

791
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,960
This is your memories

792
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:16,200
Note The not my best years

793
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:18,950
There are these, why are you looking 
everywhere for footage

794
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:20,300
I'm not looking for material

795
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:22,180
You have to face is this fact

796
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,740
Don't say, I've had enough.

797
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:28,130
Don't want to shake me, no one cares 
about this fact

798
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:28,990
Your readers care about

799
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:31,010
These things only made sense to me

800
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:33,790
There is no idea, say to listen to 
the point is boring

801
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,480
Bad words will lead to anxiety

802
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,580
If the hard construction of the idea, 
it would turn into a novel.

803
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:39,730
So what are you waiting for, start 
writing.

804
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:40,630
Write what?

805
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:42,390
You just say those.

806
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:11,570
Please forgive me for yesterday's 
behavior

807
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:13,970
I got a bad news

808
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:18,220
I had planned to get de Palma Dieu to 
write autobiography

809
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:19,470
To?

810
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,150
With men I always feel uncomfortable

811
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:26,060
But de Palma Dieu is not the same, I 
am very interested

812
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:28,450
Yeah, he has another for

813
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:32,390
Contract threatens to, he actually 
found someone else.

814
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:34,110
A man, of course

815
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,410
Cooked duck so fly

816
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:40,950
I kind of betrayed feeling

817
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:43,700
However, I also not don't understand.

818
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:46,320
The so-called men of 
understanding...this kind of stuff

819
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:55,430
Who is it?

820
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:56,940
Is the flange the cable watts

821
00:51:58,150 --> 00:51:59,530
He can't come back soon.

822
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:01,770
He was next in the third quarter of 
the program

823
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,960
Perhaps, you need this

824
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,200
Need?

825
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:08,860
Keep a little distance

826
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,510
You are very vulnerable

827
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,350
He is your boyfriend

828
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:18,960
But he was always invited to, praise 
other writers

829
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:20,530
I'm not jealous.

830
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,480
In this regard does not

831
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,390
This man across the sea to visit

832
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:28,940
He thought than the French writers of 
the more interesting writers

833
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,410
Am I wrong?

834
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:34,790
No, but it is not full so, I want 
to...

835
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:38,140
I just want to say this can't help 
you to get back confidence

836
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:42,270
It is honored that you actually for 
me to make an exception

837
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,320
Don't be kidding, What Are you 
talking about?

838
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:46,460
You sent the letter.

839
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:47,700
You meet European Lianne.

840
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:49,590
Really, I don't remember writing this 
letter

841
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:51,090
I can not talk nonsense Oh

842
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,600
"Dear gentlemen."

843
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,250
"You know, I encountered a bottleneck"

844
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:04,900
"Can't concentrate on writing, so 
this months"

845
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:07,430
"Please don't contact me, invite me"

846
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:11,230
"Write a book, I temporarily broke 
off all contact"

847
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:12,730
"Thanks for understanding"

848
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:15,040
Is you wrote?

849
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:18,170
At that time, my mind some Chaos

850
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:25,040
Thank you

851
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:41,830
I began to worry.

852
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:46,490
My bubble tea, and bought Bourbon, 
red wine

853
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,710
There are macarons to you

854
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,740
I have something important to tell you

855
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:53,810
I know you sent a letter to my friends

856
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:55,570
They please do not contact me

857
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:56,760
Yeah

858
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,460
I'm trying to help you, not distract 
you

859
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,480
But don't you think you overdo it?

860
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:04,110
You should first ask me.

861
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,210
With me in yeah, this is not enough?

862
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,580
I can't believe you would do this.

863
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:11,620
You need quiet and solitude to write 
that book.

864
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:12,320
Which book?

865
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,880
Your own story, you owe the public 
this book

866
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:16,220
You better listen up

867
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:18,430
My writing is never to please who

868
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:20,250
Now more did not intend to do so

869
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,240
Whether you want to or don't want to

870
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,790
The reader love you, you're 
responsible for them

871
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,930
This off you what happened?

872
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:28,310
What right Have you to meddle with it?

873
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:30,870
How dare you presume to help me 
decide what to write

874
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,270
You think you are?

875
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:42,570
I'm in a nearby hotel booked a room

876
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:44,840
Luggage received well, a little later 
someone will come and get

877
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:45,600
Don't do this.

878
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:46,720
Don't argue.

879
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:48,350
I see I make you very uncomfortable

880
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,720
I thought I could help you get back 
self-confidence

881
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,800
I was wrong, sorry

882
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:26,110
Are you okay?

883
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:29,750
Hurts - don't move, don't move.

884
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:33,140
I'll be right back, don't move

885
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:45,060
Delphine is!

886
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:09,460
"Knee fractures"

887
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:12,170
Didn't white throw...

888
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:15,020
The situation may be even worse

889
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:17,390
When I saw you being carried away...

890
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:19,460
I really good afraid

891
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,350
To be so over the four weeks...

892
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:30,430
Impossible.

893
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:34,580
To flange cable watts family lived, 
it would be more convenient

894
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:37,080
Others in a foreign country, I A 
person can't go.

895
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:41,270
Wait a minute, take a break

896
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,310
I can't.

897
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:49,930
If you want, I'll go with you.

898
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:51,500
Are you sure?

899
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:54,340
Yeah, I also want to write something, 
just

900
00:56:56,070 --> 00:56:58,240
I have to go get some necessities

901
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:00,670
Clothes, toiletries...

902
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:02,970
To be, I got it.

903
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:06,810
Give me the keys.

904
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:22,380
See you can stand up, I'm really happy

905
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:23,590
Barely OK...

906
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:26,250
You buy something, I receive up, you 
have to?

907
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:27,300
No, Thank you.

908
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,350
Say of is also, strawberries are 
pressed rotten.

909
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,550
Have the need for help...

910
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:34,300
No, I'm fine, Thank you very much

911
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,020
You're welcome, come on - Thank you

912
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,040
This damn weather

913
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:48,910
My husband and I met that night, is 
also such

914
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,070
Big traffic jam, I was stuck in the 
car.

915
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:55,430
Suddenly someone knocked on my car 
window

916
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:57,220
A handsome man, wearing a leather 
jacket

917
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,910
I opened the door, he got into the 
car.

918
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,240
He long?

919
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,080
Tall and rugged, a face of Hu slag

920
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:07,740
Manly

921
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,430
I immediately fell in love with him 
the taste of

922
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:13,080
Mix the wet leather and tobacco taste

923
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:15,830
If it was me, there may be wariness

924
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:18,420
Sean a car, I would want him.

925
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:21,300
We parked in a cul-de-SAC on the edge 
of the

926
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,340
Looking for a small hotel

927
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,350
Spend the passion of a night

928
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:27,530
You how old was it?

929
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:29,670
19-year-old

930
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:31,300
He is 28 years old

931
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,480
I know him, he is a mountain guide

932
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:38,300
He also climbed the K2 peak.

933
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:39,550
Just...

934
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,330
Had an accident...

935
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:43,710
Forced to give up everything

936
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,540
Later he did Express, bartender

937
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:50,900
Even wanted to open a antique shop, 
just messing around.

938
00:59:12,510 --> 00:59:14,270
It seems like everything understand.

939
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,610
We encounter

940
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:18,170
Quickly in my life made a place

941
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,770
So obvious, but I didn't see

942
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:21,620
Ella is My the write theme

943
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,230
She know, you talked to her?

944
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,670
Of course not, if let her know.

945
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,070
She would immediately close my mouth, 
and closed with the clam as tight

946
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:30,480
Gotta make her automatically leaned 
over

947
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,710
This...请君入瓮 the trick

948
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:34,310
Be sure to handle with care

949
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:37,800
Of course I will be very careful, it 
is also used to say?

950
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:39,710
I think the photo of the real life 
story

951
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,080
Her life was like a novel, I don't 
like

952
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:45,120
First of all she was willing to open 
Atrium

953
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,600
You said her mouth was tight

954
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:49,850
The

955
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:52,440
I'll let her speak as long as I'm 
able.

956
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,370
I'll get back to you

957
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,860
You can buy a Cup of coffee for me? - 
Good

958
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,400
There is also chocolate

959
01:00:10,310 --> 01:00:12,640
Are you Delphine de·Wigan? - Yes, I 
was

960
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:15,940
I'm Balzac high school librarian

961
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:17,280
Located in Durga city

962
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:19,450
Ah, Yes...

963
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:23,480
In order to invite you, we had by 
letter

964
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:25,720
Yeah, I think of it, I've seen you

965
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:31,020
I think I have not the pleasure to 
meet you

966
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,570
However, I go to school...

967
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:39,140
You also really dare say!

968
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:41,770
Don't you remember?

969
01:00:41,830 --> 01:00:44,900
I don't remember what you had coming.

970
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:48,540
Because you didn't show up

971
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:53,430
Let me remind you, de Wigan Mrs.

972
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:55,320
You even the most basic courtesy are 
not

973
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:58,230
No notification, not even a cry of 
apology.

974
01:00:58,330 --> 01:01:01,840
Please be assured that we never 
encourage students

975
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:04,020
Read your masterpiece.

976
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,090
Wish you have a pleasant evening

977
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:15,620
She want to?

978
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:18,110
Nothing, just a book fan

979
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:38,610
We agreed to the Alps Chalet stay for 
1 month

980
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:40,240
But he back out.

981
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:42,920
I insisted to go, I was wrong.

982
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:44,580
Your fault?

983
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:46,820
At the time he accepted the 
treatment, I the down his

984
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,200
I'm very self-blame

985
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:51,390
No one that is someone else's life is 
responsible for

986
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:52,800
Is?

987
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:54,910
I don't know.

988
01:01:58,870 --> 01:02:00,630
One day a sudden storm

989
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:03,190
Wooden house for only you?

990
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:04,600
Only we

991
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:07,340
We are bored as hell, and can only be 
read...

992
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:08,940
We have not had sex.

993
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,330
All day listen to the wind blow, the 
head almost blow up

994
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:17,220
A day in the morning the wind 
stopped, I go out breathable

995
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,140
Are you a man?

996
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:20,710
He didn't want to come out

997
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:24,740
I'm heading for the woods to go...then

998
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:27,390
I heard a gunshot

999
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:30,650
I look back to the Chalet to run...

1000
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:33,560
Saw his body.

1001
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:36,310
Skull burst

1002
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:38,040
Blood everywhere.

1003
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:41,930
Terrible!

1004
01:02:42,830 --> 01:02:44,010
It was a long time ago.

1005
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:05,620
My mom died, I was alone...

1006
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:09,360
Subsequently, the occurrence of fire

1007
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:10,990
Really?

1008
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,680
Yeah, the house burned, everything 
burned.

1009
01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:16,400
Fortunately, I have a friend

1010
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:18,190
My best friend, Kiki

1011
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:21,030
Kiki is? You never told me about her

1012
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:21,900
Oh, no?

1013
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:23,780
You even said You have no friends

1014
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:28,390
In fact...

1015
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:30,940
Kiki is not a real person

1016
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:33,080
Is my imaginary friend

1017
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:36,600
Very pretty little girl, red hair.

1018
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:39,700
I want to talk to her to run away 
together, just the two of us

1019
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:42,260
No one to bother us

1020
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:57,830
What's the matter?

1021
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:02,790
You get up to?

1022
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:04,930
I didn't hear you get up

1023
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:06,530
I'm up for a long time

1024
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:09,120
Are you okay? - Okay

1025
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:20,630
That I let you concentrate on work.

1026
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:33,000
Get

1027
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:35,010
Things such as what I think

1028
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:36,710
She took the bait.

1029
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:37,980
What does that mean?

1030
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:39,940
She thinks I'm in Recalling their own 
past

1031
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:41,890
So remove the heart of Defense, to me 
your heart.

1032
01:05:42,780 --> 01:05:43,360
Great!

1033
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:45,110
I can't let her according to the time 
order of speaking

1034
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:46,710
So are intermittent small story

1035
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:48,920
I have to think of a way to connect

1036
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:52,820
The simplest method is recording, but 
the risk is too high

1037
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:55,150
I have to hang up.

1038
01:05:57,810 --> 01:05:59,080
Noon to eat what?

1039
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,910
Don't know, whatever.

1040
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:08,740
Tell you now a bit early, but...

1041
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:11,650
I started as a new book intended to 
outline the

1042
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:13,090
Really?

1043
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:15,550
Very intimate content

1044
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,870
From a personal perspective to 
re-examine their

1045
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:20,980
You mean the autobiography?

1046
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:21,970
Yes!

1047
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:26,420
I can't say too much, the story of 
architecture is also very weak

1048
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:28,430
Similar to the confessions of the like

1049
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:31,980
Now I can't boot

1050
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:35,180
Or on paper to write notes, but

1051
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:37,640
I can be recording, so slowly there 
is progress

1052
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:40,450
Talk to you before that the 
follow-up? - Of course

1053
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:42,310
Will be very painful

1054
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:44,450
But you're right.

1055
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:46,400
This is to face the time

1056
01:06:58,770 --> 01:07:00,180
I never told you

1057
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:02,510
My mom also committed suicide.

1058
01:07:06,830 --> 01:07:09,160
I found her lying in the hallway on 
the floor

1059
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:13,160
Wearing my favorite yellow floral 
dress.

1060
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:16,030
I was 4 years old

1061
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,620
I firmly against her.

1062
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,470
So spent...several hours

1063
01:08:19,810 --> 01:08:21,340
Today is 2 months 7 days

1064
01:08:22,210 --> 01:08:23,650
I re-start writing

1065
01:08:24,190 --> 01:08:25,500
If necessary, loudly say.

1066
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:28,350
Yesterday she finally remove the 
heart of Defense

1067
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:30,040
That a few pieces of the past

1068
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:31,540
This is just a beginning

1069
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:35,380
The point is, to win her trust

1070
01:08:35,730 --> 01:08:37,110
I know how to do

1071
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:40,560
She created a fantasy friend, Kiki

1072
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:42,160
She wants to talk to Kiki run away 
together

1073
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:43,980
Kiki tells her that they will have 
new life

1074
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,340
The house burned down, everything up 
in smoke

1075
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,550
Tall and rugged, a face full of Hu 
residue, Manly

1076
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:50,210
Wooden house only they

1077
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:51,270
She found his body.

1078
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:53,190
Skull burst, blood everywhere.

1079
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:02,390
Can't you just wait?

1080
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:09,040
Don't follow me around the turn

1081
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,500
Or you'll break the other knee

1082
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,240
(Ella)

1083
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,250
Tell me, what the hell you're writing!

1084
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:14,130
No, the confidentiality provisions of 
provision than the contract length

1085
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,250
I won't tell.

1086
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:16,850
You might slip out.

1087
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:18,160
Who is it?

1088
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:21,230
Actress? Female politicians are?

1089
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:22,920
The answer is not very close?

1090
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:26,050
Female singer? Athletes?

1091
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,550
Catherine Deneuve is? Kim Kardashian 
for?

1092
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:30,150
Los can be·Hever God is!

1093
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,260
(Imaginary friends Kiki)

1094
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:56,230
To close the window.

1095
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:18,990
Rats

1096
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:21,420
I'm telling you, the house has rats!

1097
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,940
You see the mice?

1098
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,500
I saw two only got into the cellar

1099
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:29,890
Calm down, calm down, it's okay.

1100
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:34,370
Sit down...alone.

1101
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:39,200
We went to buy the rat trap to 
destroy it

1102
01:11:39,260 --> 01:11:40,190
Don't worry, it's okay.

1103
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:51,190
You can go off the cellar door?

1104
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:52,940
I didn't have time to watch

1105
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:59,630
Please help me to get crutches

1106
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:50,740
The supermarket didn't sell, so I 
went to town.

1107
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,360
Rat trap, the exterminator, I have 
bought

1108
01:12:54,710 --> 01:12:56,050
Be sure to fully wipe them out

1109
01:12:57,110 --> 01:12:59,180
The clerk was just...

1110
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:01,650
Just what? He's not a sorcerer.

1111
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:05,830
Just to give you go to put, I don't 
go down

1112
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:08,390
Just very sorry...

1113
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:09,510
I'm really afraid of

1114
01:14:28,350 --> 01:14:30,390
I'm also not baipaoyitang the 
supermarket, you see!

1115
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:31,890
I can't see!

1116
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:50,750
I generally love to eat plain, just 
add a little lemon

1117
01:14:50,850 --> 01:14:52,350
But you get the sauce very successful

1118
01:14:52,710 --> 01:14:55,490
It's not difficult, is the most 
common cooking method

1119
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:56,830
I cook not out

1120
01:14:57,470 --> 01:14:58,230
Come again?

1121
01:14:58,620 --> 01:14:59,990
No, I'm good support

1122
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:01,820
I already eat two disc a

1123
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:03,670
I open a bottle of wine

1124
01:15:03,930 --> 01:15:04,950
Also good...

1125
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:09,100
My dad he...

1126
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,280
Every day can drink 3 bottles of

1127
01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:18,150
My mother passed away after me and 
him had each other

1128
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:21,060
I'm afraid of him, he has violent 
tendencies

1129
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:23,200
He...

1130
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:26,720
My body hurt is his masterpiece

1131
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:30,110
He locked me in the house

1132
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:32,150
He died in that fire

1133
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:33,620
I'm finally free.

1134
01:15:36,630 --> 01:15:37,780
How did things happen?

1135
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:40,460
Is arson

1136
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:43,150
Who put the fire?

1137
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:44,880
Have not been found to

1138
01:15:48,870 --> 01:15:49,800
You have to wonder who?

1139
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:54,630
I think is Kiki

1140
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:59,300
I cooked a fish soup for dinner.

1141
01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:02,880
Soup? Fantastic

1142
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:04,960
Didn't you say you love to drink soup?

1143
01:18:09,630 --> 01:18:12,090
Your body is hot, gotta think of a 
way to bring the fever down

1144
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:29,300
Hello?

1145
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:34,310
No, I'm not Delphine, I'm her friend 
Ella

1146
01:19:34,410 --> 01:19:35,270
We haven't met

1147
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:38,180
Where you are from?

1148
01:19:39,370 --> 01:19:40,390
I can't hear you

1149
01:19:42,630 --> 01:19:43,620
From Wyoming it?

1150
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:48,190
Delphine sleep, and food poisoning

1151
01:19:49,950 --> 01:19:52,470
No, not serious, etc. her up and then 
call back

1152
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,030
I re-start writing

1153
01:19:58,390 --> 01:19:59,790
If necessary, loudly say.

1154
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,800
Yesterday she finally remove the 
heart of Defense

1155
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:04,460
That a few pieces of the past

1156
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:06,030
This is just a beginning

1157
01:20:07,150 --> 01:20:09,350
The point is, to win her trust

1158
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,240
I know how to do

1159
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:15,580
She mentioned a fire

1160
01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:17,980
But unwilling to say more

1161
01:20:19,070 --> 01:20:20,540
But I will make her come clean

1162
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:23,550
She also mentioned the suicide of the 
Mother

1163
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:46,720
I made you soup

1164
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:49,470
I'm not hungry, my stomach 
uncomfortable

1165
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:52,320
So you should not an empty stomach.

1166
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:56,410
I can't eat

1167
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:06,420
Try again - please.

1168
01:21:06,510 --> 01:21:07,530
Come, come on

1169
01:21:14,830 --> 01:21:16,360
I beg you...please

1170
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:17,800
Don't, don't

1171
01:21:17,930 --> 01:21:20,070
First aside

1172
01:21:20,580 --> 01:21:21,860
I'll eat again

1173
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,490
I'm busy for half a day to get you 
soup...

1174
01:22:18,730 --> 01:22:20,100
I soak a Cup of hot cocoa to you

1175
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:24,870
I contact not on Francois

1176
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:27,840
Never mind, something he would call 
again.

1177
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:32,190
Help me with the kids.

1178
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:33,630
Has been notified

1179
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:37,850
You should drink a little

1180
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:39,280
You didn't eat

1181
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:44,460
Come, obediently obedient

1182
01:22:45,490 --> 01:22:46,410
Barely drink a little

1183
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:50,730
Don't cheat.

1184
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:52,070
Drink!

1185
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,400
! Drink!

1186
01:24:08,830 --> 01:24:09,880
Delphine is!

1187
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:17,940
Delphine is! - ?

1188
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:20,140
I'm Raymond -?

1189
01:24:26,090 --> 01:24:26,950
?

1190
01:24:27,470 --> 01:24:28,870
Here I am - Delphine is!

1191
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:30,150
?

1192
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:20,230
Hey, you guys, look here!

1193
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,390
You scared me to death.

1194
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:53,030
I don't understand, is because of me?

1195
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,230
Because I always not around?

1196
01:28:56,510 --> 01:28:58,110
I jumped on the first plane.

1197
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,120
You're lucky

1198
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,550
Luckily someone found in a timely 
manner you

1199
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:07,060
Why do you want to die for?

1200
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:10,990
I did not want to die.

1201
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:14,700
Test report test out sleeping pills 
mixed sulfate thallium

1202
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,640
That was the rodenticide of the main 
ingredients

1203
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:21,380
You still no clue?

1204
01:29:23,270 --> 01:29:25,960
You should remember that you talk to 
her by phone?

1205
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,290
She for me to answer the phone, don't 
you feel strange?

1206
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:30,050
You have to believe me.

1207
01:29:30,110 --> 01:29:33,180
I didn't tell Ella spoken to - know.

1208
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:35,100
Not just that night, no, never

1209
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:35,990
Good

1210
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:38,740
I don't call you, you're shut down

1211
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,530
Off, you know?

1212
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:42,000
So I'm calling Raymond

1213
01:29:42,070 --> 01:29:43,000
Raymond is?

1214
01:29:44,150 --> 01:29:45,650
Our neighbor, Raymond.

1215
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:49,360
The Windows were tightly closed, he 
knocks on the door and shake the 
window

1216
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:51,150
Ah, the original is Raymond?

1217
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:52,590
Why don't you open the door?

1218
01:29:52,910 --> 01:29:55,140
Because Ella gave me Poison.

1219
01:29:56,810 --> 01:29:58,560
You don't believe me even if the

1220
01:29:59,330 --> 01:30:00,290
I believe you

1221
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:02,850
Sorry to keep you waiting

1222
01:30:03,330 --> 01:30:04,160
Come in

1223
01:30:04,930 --> 01:30:06,360
Come in, sit down, please

1224
01:30:08,540 --> 01:30:10,460
I very like

1225
01:30:10,550 --> 01:30:12,120
Suspenseful and exciting

1226
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:13,400
This is probably you have written the 
best book.

1227
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:15,440
Karina, this 3 years I didn't write 
anything

1228
01:30:15,510 --> 01:30:17,100
I have not sent what document to you

1229
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:18,510
But I really receive the presentation.

1230
01:30:18,610 --> 01:30:21,200

01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:41,310
I was very touched

1236
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:44,020
Your book every day I see, I love

01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:46,070
