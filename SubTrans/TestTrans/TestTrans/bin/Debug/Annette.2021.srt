<i>'Cause you bore me,
you bore me, you bore me</i>

00:11:36,218 --> 00:11:37,803
<i>I'll still make you</i>

160
00:11:37,886 --> 00:11:40,263
<i>Gasp, gasp, gasp</i>

161
00:11:40,347 --> 00:11:42,974
<i>But don't worry, don't worry,
don't worry</i>

162
00:11:43,058 --> 00:11:45,060
<i>You probably will not</i>

163
00:11:45,143 --> 00:11:47,396
<i>Choke, choke, choke</i>

164
00:11:47,479 --> 00:11:49,898
<i>Kick the bucket, kick
the bucket, kick the bucket</i>

165
00:11:49,981 --> 00:11:52,275
<i>Kick the bucket</i>

166
00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:07,416
<i>Huh.</i>

167
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:11,336
<i>Well, of course,</i>

168
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,047
<i>I've heard the rumors, too.</i>

169
00:12:14,131 --> 00:12:15,882
<i>They say my show kills.</i>

170
00:12:17,134 --> 00:12:19,845
<i>But relax, see my contract?</i>

171
00:12:19,928 --> 00:12:21,346
<i>Save your breath.</i>

172
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,057
<i>Says so here:</i>

173
00:12:24,141 --> 00:12:26,017
<i>"Mr. Henry McHenry
is not allowed</i>

174
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:27,686

175
00:12:35,277 --> 00:12:38,113
<i>Can't make your alveoli
pop tonight.</i>

176
00:12:38,196 --> 00:12:42,367
<i>No dislocated jaws,
no belly explosions.</i>

177

<i>However, asthmatics,</i>

178
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:48,331
<i>Keep your inhalers in position!</i>

179
00:12:48,415 --> 00:12:50,250

- Okay!</i>

180
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,210
<i>- Ready?
- Ready!</i>

181
00:12:52,294 --> 00:12:53,503
<i>Laugh.</i>

182
00:12:53,587 --> 00:12:56,923
<i>Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha,
ha-ha, ha-ha</i>

00:13:07,392 --> 00:13:08,435
<i>Okay, shut up.</i>

187
00:13:35,795 --> 00:13:37,589
<i>Yes.</i>

188
00:13:37,672 --> 00:13:38,840
<i>Why did I become a comedian?</i>

189
00:13:38,924 --> 00:13:40,359
<i>Why did I
become a comedian?</i>

190
00:13:40,383 --> 00:13:42,594
<i>To entertain some balding men?</i>

191
00:13:42,677 --> 00:13:45,305
<i>To bring a touch of levity
to tragic times?</i>

192
00:13:45,388 --> 00:13:47,224
<i>Not me.</i>

193
00:13:47,307 --> 00:13:49,643
<i>To bring some joy
to those who have none?</i>

194
00:13:49,726 --> 00:13:52,687
<i>To cast a skeptical eye
toward common knowledge?</i>

195
00:13:52,771 --> 00:13:54,731
<i>- Uh-uh.
- Why did I become a comedian?</i>

196
00:13:54,773 --> 00:13:56,709
<i>To make you notice what you've
always surely noticed,</i>

197
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:58,610
<i>never noticing you noticed
until I ask you:</i>

198
00:13:58,693 --> 00:14:01,071
<i>- "Have you ever noticed?"
- Why did I become a comedian?</i>

199
00:14:01,154 --> 00:14:03,382
<i>- Sure, but not only that.
- Why did I become a comedian?</i>

200
00:14:03,406 --> 00:14:05,116
<i>To convey with a smile</i>

201
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,912
<i>these deep-seated feelings
of hatred and humiliation</i>

202
00:14:08,995 --> 00:14:11,081
<i>we all seem to be sharing?</i>

203
00:14:11,164 --> 00:14:12,391
<i>When...</i>

204
00:14:12,415 --> 00:14:15,043
<i>All the Catholics
hate the Muslims</i>

205
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:17,504
<i>And the Muslims
hate the Catholics</i>

206
00:14:17,587 --> 00:14:19,756
<i>And the Tutsis hate the Hutus</i>

207
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,050
<i>And... everybody
hates the Jews</i>

208
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:30,850
<i>- So, why, Henry?
- Yes, why, Henry?</i>

209
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:32,227
<i>Why?</i>

210
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,437
<i>Yes, why did you
become a comedian?</i>

211
00:14:34,521 --> 00:14:36,773
<i>- For the money?
- For the money?</i>

212
00:14:36,856 --> 00:14:38,441
<i>Oh, no, no.</i>

213
00:14:38,525 --> 00:14:42,779
<i>No, I've come from poverty
and severity</i>

214
00:14:42,862 --> 00:14:45,574
<i>and now have reached big money
and obscenity.</i>

215
00:14:45,657 --> 00:14:47,409
<i>So why did you become
a comedian?</i>

216
00:14:47,492 --> 00:14:49,619
<i>- For the fame?
- For the fame?</i>

217
00:14:49,703 --> 00:14:51,871
<i>Oh, no, no.</i>

218
00:14:51,955 --> 00:14:54,874
<i>Though fame is like a flame,</i>

219
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,002
<i>glorious,</i>

220
00:14:57,085 --> 00:14:58,378
<i>superfluous.</i>

221
00:14:58,461 --> 00:15:00,088
<i>So nice being famous
for being infamous.</i>

222
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:03,258
<i>Okay, but why did you become
a comedian?</i>

223
00:15:03,341 --> 00:15:04,884
<i>- Fear of death?
- Fear of death?</i>

224
00:15:04,968 --> 00:15:06,136
<i>Oh, no, no.</i>

225
00:15:06,219 --> 00:15:08,597
<i>'Cause you see, I have sympathy
for the abyss.</i>

226
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,640
<i>What did he say?
What is "abyss"?</i>

227
00:15:10,724 --> 00:15:13,560
<i>A-B-Y-S-S!</i>

228
00:15:13,643 --> 00:15:14,978
<i>You illiterates.</i>

229
00:15:17,814 --> 00:15:20,775
<i>That's why I must never...</i>

230
00:15:20,859 --> 00:15:23,695
<i>never cast my eyes
towards the abyss.</i>

231
00:15:31,703 --> 00:15:33,788
<i>Lady, that's quite an abyss
you've got.</i>

232
00:15:35,874 --> 00:15:38,627
<i>So why, why did you become
a comedian?</i>

233
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,003
<i>For the women?</i>

234
00:15:40,086 --> 00:15:42,380
<i>Oh, no, well...</i>

235
00:15:42,464 --> 00:15:43,506
<i>Okay, let me explain.</i>

236
00:15:57,145 --> 00:15:59,147
<i>You see...</i>

237
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:02,359
<i>my serial pussy days are over.</i>

238
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,528
<i>Because, well...</i>

239
00:16:05,612 --> 00:16:08,031
<i>I've, I've just met someone.</i>

240
00:16:10,158 --> 00:16:12,160
<i>Someone so...</i>

241
00:16:13,828 --> 00:16:16,498
<i>It all went so fast.</i>

242
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:19,376
<i>I just moved into her tiny
hidden palace,</i>

243
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:21,795
<i>'cause, yes, she's a queen.</i>

244
00:16:21,878 --> 00:16:24,005
<i>And now,</i>

245
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:25,840
<i>I'm engaged.</i>

246
00:16:29,469 --> 00:16:31,429
<i>I know, I know.</i>

247
00:16:31,513 --> 00:16:33,932
<i>Marrying a girl when you're
as young and green as me,</i>

248
00:16:34,015 --> 00:16:36,726
<i>it's like...
swimming the Atlantic</i>

249
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:39,521
<i>with a concrete block
tied to your left testicle.</i>

250
00:16:42,273 --> 00:16:44,651
<i>Well, yes, now, I'm engaged.</i>

251
00:16:45,902 --> 00:16:48,071
<i>Copped out in my early age.</i>

252
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:50,907
<i>So who, you ask, would marry me?</i>

253
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:53,159
<i>Who would be the least likely?</i>

254
00:16:54,452 --> 00:16:57,455
<i>No, this ain't a joke so far:</i>

255
00:16:57,539 --> 00:16:59,708
<i>-Yes, Ann Defrasnoux,
-WOMAN: Oh, no!</i>

256
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,710
<i>The opera star.</i>

257
00:17:01,793 --> 00:17:03,503
<i>What?</i>

258
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:04,754
<i>What's wrong, lady?</i>

259
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:07,298
<i>Ann and me, you disagree?</i>

260
00:17:07,382 --> 00:17:09,467
<i>What is it, blasphemy?</i>

261
00:17:09,551 --> 00:17:11,803
<i>Why, is she too...</i>

262
00:17:11,886 --> 00:17:12,929
<i>perfect?</i>

263
00:17:13,012 --> 00:17:14,389
<i>Yes, yes, yes</i>

264
00:17:14,472 --> 00:17:18,101
<i>And I, some loathsome insect?</i>

265
00:17:18,184 --> 00:17:19,728
<i>Yes, yes, yes</i>

266
00:17:19,811 --> 00:17:21,104
<i>Okay, I'll accept that.</i>

267
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:31,990
<i>First time I fell in love...</i>

268
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,952
<i>...woke up next to the girl...</i>

269
00:17:37,412 --> 00:17:38,830
<i>...rushed out to buy myself</i>

270
00:17:38,913 --> 00:17:42,625
<i>the biggest motorbike
I could find</i>

271
00:17:42,709 --> 00:17:45,086
<i>and escaped</i>

272
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,963
<i>fast and far.</i>

273
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:52,177
<i>But Ann the soprano
has changed me.</i>

274
00:17:54,471 --> 00:17:56,055
<i>I have changed.</i>

275
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:00,101
<i>How?</i>

276
00:18:00,185 --> 00:18:02,604
<i>I'm still not sure.</i>

277
00:18:02,687 --> 00:18:04,939
<i>Time will tell.</i>

278
00:18:05,023 --> 00:18:06,983
<i>What I see in her</i>

279
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:08,485
<i>is obvious.</i>

280
00:18:09,694 --> 00:18:12,113
<i>What she sees in me,</i>

281
00:18:12,197 --> 00:18:14,449
<i>hmm...</i>

282
00:18:14,532 --> 00:18:16,201
<i>it's a little more puzzling.</i>

283
00:18:19,037 --> 00:18:20,872
<i>Wish that she could
be here now</i>

284
00:18:20,955 --> 00:18:22,791
<i>But she's at the opera tonight</i>

285
00:18:22,874 --> 00:18:26,336
<i>Opera, where everything
is sacred</i>

286
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:27,545
<i>Amen!</i>

287
00:18:27,629 --> 00:18:29,172
<i>First she dies and dies and dies</i>

288
00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:31,466
<i>And then she bows
and bows and bows</i>

289
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:33,510
<i>She'll be bowing now till dawn</i>

290
00:18:33,593 --> 00:18:35,428
<i>Ann, dear, I love you so</i>

291
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:37,597
<i>But all that bowing's got to go</i>

292
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,682
<i>Take a last bow, enough</i>

293
00:18:39,766 --> 00:18:41,893
<i>Make it seem more off the cuff</i>

294
00:18:43,394 --> 00:18:45,730
<i>But, Henry, you didn't answer:</i>

295
00:18:45,814 --> 00:18:47,565
<i>why?</i>

296
00:18:47,649 --> 00:18:49,651
<i>Yes, why did you
become a comedian?</i>

297
00:18:49,734 --> 00:18:51,736
<i>So, why did you become
a comedian?</i>

298
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,948
<i>Yes, why did you
become a comedian?</i>

299
00:18:55,031 --> 00:18:56,741
<i>Hey, Henry?!</i>

300
00:18:56,825 --> 00:18:58,326
<i>Why?</i>

301
00:18:58,409 --> 00:18:59,828
<i>I'll tell you why.</i>

302
00:19:03,915 --> 00:19:05,750
<i>To disarm people.</i>

303
00:19:08,253 --> 00:19:10,672
<i>Make them laugh.</i>

304
00:19:13,508 --> 00:19:15,301
<i>It's the only way I know
to tell the truth</i>

305
00:19:15,385 --> 00:19:17,136
<i>without getting killed.</i>

306
00:19:21,182 --> 00:19:22,600
<i>Anyway, every fuckin'...</i>

307
00:19:35,154 --> 00:19:37,448
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

308
00:19:38,408 --> 00:19:40,660
<i>Henry, you bastard!</i>

309
00:19:42,412 --> 00:19:44,664
<i>Ooh.</i>

310
00:19:44,747 --> 00:19:46,749
<i>Fuck you, Henry!</i>

311
00:19:50,086 --> 00:19:51,421
<i>See, I, too, can die.</i>

312
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,924
<i>And then...</i>

313
00:19:55,008 --> 00:19:56,384

00:49:44,337 --> 00:49:45,922
<i>Whoo! Yeah!</i>

630
00:49:46,005 --> 00:49:50,093
<i>Henry!</i>

631
00:49:50,176 --> 00:49:51,678
<i>Fucking idiotic smoke.</i>

632
00:49:54,681 --> 00:49:56,516
<i>Have you no sense
of proportions?!</i>

633
00:50:05,024 --> 00:50:08,778
<i>Having to be funny here,
it's like...</i>

634
00:50:08,861 --> 00:50:11,239
<i>...trying to enjoy a blow job
in a gas chamber.</i>

635
00:50:12,699 --> 00:50:13,783
<i>Ah, man.</i>

636
00:50:13,866 --> 00:50:15,785
<i>That was not funny, Henry.</i>

637
00:50:26,212 --> 00:50:28,047
<i>You're right, not funny.</i>

638
00:50:30,717 --> 00:50:31,801
<i>I'm so...</i>

639
00:50:34,554 --> 00:50:36,389
<i>...too fucking tired.</i>

640
00:50:50,611 --> 00:50:53,448
<i>I knew it. I should've cancelled
the show tonight.</i>

641
00:50:53,531 --> 00:50:55,950
<i>No, no, no!</i>

642
00:50:56,033 --> 00:50:57,910
<i>Yes, yes, yes.</i>

643
00:50:59,537 --> 00:51:00,955
<i>You see, my house was...</i>

644
00:51:02,457 --> 00:51:04,625
<i>...broken into last night,</i>

645
00:51:04,709 --> 00:51:07,211
<i>and, mm, bastards
stole all my jokes.</i>

646
00:51:09,213 --> 00:51:10,631
<i>No, the truth is...</i>

647
00:51:13,342 --> 00:51:16,220
<i>...now that I have
my own soprano</i>

648
00:51:16,304 --> 00:51:19,140
<i>and baby...</i>

649
00:51:20,892 --> 00:51:22,560
<i>...I'm not sure I have it
in me anymore</i>

650
00:51:22,643 --> 00:51:24,437
<i>to make sad people laugh.</i>

651
00:51:26,147 --> 00:51:28,983
<i>No, the truth is, this morning,</i>

652
00:51:29,066 --> 00:51:30,735
<i>something happened.</i>

653
00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:35,573
<i>I-I... No, no, I can't say.</i>

654
00:51:35,656 --> 00:51:37,742
<i>No, the truth is I'm sick.</i>

655
00:51:37,825 --> 00:51:40,328
<i>Being in love makes me sick.</i>

656
00:51:40,411 --> 00:51:41,829
<i>Sick!</i>

657
00:51:46,375 --> 00:51:49,003
<i>Well, the true truth is...</i>

658
00:51:49,086 --> 00:51:50,505
<i>this morning...</i>

659
00:51:53,341 --> 00:51:54,759
<i>I, um...</i>

660
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,639
<i>I killed... my wife.</i>

661
00:51:59,722 --> 00:52:01,808
<i>What? What was that?</i>

662
00:52:01,891 --> 00:52:03,643
<i>- Louder!
- Louder, Henry!</i>

663
00:52:03,726 --> 00:52:06,062
<i>- Can't hear you back here.
- Your mic, Henry!</i>

664
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:14,070
<i>I killed my wife.</i>

665
00:52:21,327 --> 00:52:23,329
<i>Yes, laugh, laugh, laugh.</i>

666
00:52:24,372 --> 00:52:25,957
<i>Laugh, laugh, laugh.</i>

667
00:52:27,124 --> 00:52:29,168
<i>So, I've said it:</i>

668
00:52:29,252 --> 00:52:31,003
<i>I killed my wife.</i>

669
00:52:33,714 --> 00:52:34,882
<i>I didn't mean to.</i>

670
00:52:36,425 --> 00:52:38,427
<i>God knows I didn't mean to.</i>

671
00:52:39,637 --> 00:52:41,597
<i>She woke up,</i>

672
00:52:41,681 --> 00:52:43,432
<i>so beautiful.</i>

673
00:52:47,979 --> 00:52:49,897
<i>That smile.</i>

674
00:52:49,981 --> 00:52:53,234
<i>She is... was...
A very shy person, you see,</i>

675
00:52:53,317 --> 00:52:56,821
<i>and I know,
I knew this shy smile</i>

676
00:52:56,904 --> 00:52:59,031
<i>meant she wanted to fuck.</i>

677
00:52:59,115 --> 00:53:01,868
<i>But this time,
I pretended not to get it.</i>

678
00:53:01,951 --> 00:53:05,663
<i>And I kept on pretending
and so she said it,</i>

679
00:53:05,746 --> 00:53:07,373
<i>ever so shyly:</i>

680
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,418
<i>"Please, Henry.</i>

681
00:53:12,378 --> 00:53:13,796
<i>Fuck me, Henry."</i>

682
00:53:15,381 --> 00:53:17,884
<i>And I could see the effort
in her smile,</i>

683
00:53:17,967 --> 00:53:20,136
<i>for her to ask that,</i>

684
00:53:20,219 --> 00:53:22,179
<i>to say those dirty words,</i>

685
00:53:22,263 --> 00:53:25,892
<i>to be wicked and bold,
so out of character.</i>

686
00:53:25,975 --> 00:53:29,020
<i>With that very shy smile
I loved so much.</i>

687
00:53:29,103 --> 00:53:30,771
<i>But I couldn't answer,</i>

688
00:53:30,855 --> 00:53:32,690
<i>I couldn't meet her desire.</i>

689
00:53:32,773 --> 00:53:35,234
<i>'Cause, yes,
being in love makes me sick.</i>

690
00:53:35,318 --> 00:53:36,652
<i>Sick!</i>

691
00:53:36,736 --> 00:53:39,030
<i>I had been sleepless
all night, you see,</i>

692
00:53:39,113 --> 00:53:41,866
<i>suffocating, suffocated by love.</i>

693
00:53:41,949 --> 00:53:43,159
<i>A wreck.</i>

694
00:53:43,242 --> 00:53:44,911
<i>Absolutely no desire left.</i>

695
00:53:44,994 --> 00:53:47,121
<i>Come on, Henry, drop it, please!</i>

696
00:53:47,204 --> 00:53:49,373
<i>Yeah.</i>

697
00:53:49,457 --> 00:53:52,001
<i>What? Am I letting you know more
than you care to know about me?</i>

698
00:53:52,084 --> 00:53:53,502
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

699
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:57,298
<i>About her?</i>

700
00:53:59,091 --> 00:54:00,259
<i>Sex?</i>

701
00:54:04,221 --> 00:54:05,306
<i>Death?</i>

702
00:54:08,434 --> 00:54:10,269
<i>Yes, no desire left.</i>

703
00:54:11,729 --> 00:54:13,064
<i>Zero.</i>

704
00:54:13,981 --> 00:54:16,233
<i>So I was looking for something,</i>

705
00:54:16,317 --> 00:54:19,278
<i>anything to change the subject,</i>

706
00:54:19,362 --> 00:54:21,906
<i>to spare us both this horrible,</i>

707
00:54:21,989 --> 00:54:24,033
<i>dreadful moment of rejection.</i>

708
00:54:24,116 --> 00:54:26,744
<i>That's when the idea came to me.</i>

709
00:54:26,827 --> 00:54:30,289
<i>I remembered how extremely
ticklish she is... was...</i>

710
00:54:30,373 --> 00:54:32,750
<i>Especially on the soles
of her feet.</i>

711
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:35,503
<i>So I thought: I'll tickle her,</i>

712
00:54:35,586 --> 00:54:37,004
<i>to change the subject.</i>

713
00:54:37,088 --> 00:54:38,339
<i>So I grabbed her legs,</i>

714
00:54:38,422 --> 00:54:40,007
<i>locked both of her feet
under my arms</i>

715
00:54:40,091 --> 00:54:41,592
<i>and started to tickle them.</i>

716
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:45,972
<i>I could see in her eyes
she understood it all.</i>

717
00:54:47,932 --> 00:54:49,600
<i>Why I was doing what I was doing</i>

718
00:54:49,684 --> 00:54:51,185
<i>to change the subject.</i>

719
00:54:53,062 --> 00:54:55,398
<i>And it seemed impossible
she would laugh this time.</i>

720
00:54:55,481 --> 00:54:56,983
<i>She was hurt.</i>

721
00:54:57,066 --> 00:54:58,734
<i>And ashamed.</i>

722
00:54:58,818 --> 00:55:00,027
<i>And sad and confused.</i>

723
00:55:01,445 --> 00:55:03,864
<i>But I persisted,
I tickled gently...</i>

724
00:55:09,912 --> 00:55:11,414
<i>"Stop it, Henry."</i>

725
00:55:13,165 --> 00:55:14,792
<i>It wasn't working.</i>

726
00:55:14,875 --> 00:55:16,293
<i>So I tickled stronger.</i>

727
00:55:23,259 --> 00:55:24,677
<i>I tickled madly.</i>

728
00:55:29,473 --> 00:55:30,766
<i>I tickled wild.</i>

729
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:52,872
<i>Ann?</i>

730
00:55:53,914 --> 00:55:55,166
<i>Ann.</i>

731
00:55:56,959 --> 00:55:59,211
<i>Ann? Ann!</i>

732
00:56:07,595 --> 00:56:09,138
<i>No, no, no, Ann!</i>

733
00:56:12,141 --> 00:56:13,392
<i>Ann!</i>

734
00:56:14,602 --> 00:56:15,853
<i>Ann!</i>

735
00:56:17,354 --> 00:56:18,814
<i>No!</i>

736
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,152
<i>No, Ann!</i>

737
00:56:28,074 --> 00:56:29,325
<i>No!</i>

738
00:56:42,088 --> 00:56:43,798
<i>I had tickled her to death.</i>

739
00:56:51,597 --> 00:56:53,682
<i>I then tried to kill myself.</i>

740
00:56:53,766 --> 00:56:55,976
<i>The same way, tickling myself.</i>

741
00:57:08,948 --> 00:57:10,950
<i>You know, but it didn't work.</i>

742
00:57:28,843 --> 00:57:31,178
<i>This is how I killed my wife.</i>

743
00:57:31,262 --> 00:57:32,930
<i>Enough. I'm out.</i>

744
00:57:34,223 --> 00:57:35,641
<i>You're sick!</i>

745
00:57:39,812 --> 00:57:41,313
<i>That's fucked up.</i>

746
00:57:41,397 --> 00:57:43,107
<i>That was sick!</i>

747
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:44,650
<i>You're sick!</i>

748
00:57:44,733 --> 00:57:45,985
<i>Poor Ann!</i>

749
00:57:46,068 --> 00:57:47,319
<i>Poor Annette!</i>

750
00:57:48,529 --> 00:57:50,030
<i>I sense some animosity.</i>

751
00:57:50,114 --> 00:57:51,365
<i>Am I right, or is it me?</i>

752
00:57:51,448 --> 00:57:54,326
<i>You must've bitten something
bitter in your cradle!</i>

753
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:55,703
<i>Bitten, bitter, cradle!</i>

754
00:57:55,786 --> 00:57:57,705
<i>So why did I become a comedian?</i>

755
00:57:57,788 --> 00:57:59,373
<i>You're not! You're not!</i>

756
00:57:59,456 --> 00:58:00,499
<i>Not anymore!</i>

757
00:58:00,583 --> 00:58:02,251
<i>So why did I become a comedian?</i>

758
00:58:02,334 --> 00:58:03,669
<i>Asshole! Asshole!</i>

759
00:58:03,752 --> 00:58:05,296
<i>Sick, sick, sick!</i>

760
00:58:05,379 --> 00:58:07,798
<i>- Asshole!
- Okay.</i>

761
00:58:07,882 --> 00:58:10,134
<i>- Go home!
- Ready?</i>

762
00:58:10,217 --> 00:58:11,385
<i>Laugh!</i>

763

00:58:21,395 --> 00:58:22,897
<i>We promised that you'd laugh</i>

767

770
00:58:30,738 --> 00:58:32,406
<i>'Cause he's Henry, he's Henry...</i>

771
00:58:32,489 --> 00:58:36,410
<i>Okay, everybody, thank you
very much, but enough already.</i>

772
00:58:36,493 --> 00:58:37,828
<i>Have a good night!</i>

773
00:58:37,912 --> 00:58:40,497
<i>Kick the bucket, kick the
bucket, kick the bucket</i>

774
00:58:40,581 --> 00:58:43,125
<i>He needs to hear you
clap, clap, clap</i>

775
00:58:44,919 --> 00:58:47,796
<i>'Cause he's Henry, he's Henry,
The Henry</i>

776
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:01,352
<i>You used to laugh</i>

777
00:59:01,435 --> 00:59:04,396
<i>But now you sure ain't laughing
at me no more</i>

778
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:05,981
<i>You used to laugh</i>

<i>- Do you think I care?
- Henry, Henry, we've had enough</i>

941
01:09:05,288 --> 01:09:10,752
<i>Alakazam, I'll change the reel</i>

942
01:09:10,836 --> 01:09:16,341
<i>Look at the happy family dancing</i>

943
01:09:16,424 --> 01:09:19,553
<i>We'll look back and laugh</i>

944
01:09:19,636 --> 01:09:22,055
<i>That crazy night</i>

945
01:09:22,138 --> 01:09:24,975
<i>As we walk a path</i>

946
01:09:25,058 --> 01:09:27,477
<i>Neath city lights</i>

947
01:09:27,561 --> 01:09:30,772
<i>The lights will shine on you</i>

948
01:09:30,856 --> 01:09:36,736
<i>My little innocent.</i>

949
01:09:48,081 --> 01:09:50,834
<i>Henry!</i>

950
01:09:50,917 --> 01:09:53,169
<i>Henry!</i>

951
01:09:53,253 --> 01:09:58,174
<i>Henry, where are you?</i>

952
01:10:08,894 --> 01:10:10,061
<i>Henry?</i>

953
01:10:12,439 --> 01:10:13,607
<i>Henry?</i>

954
01:10:15,358 --> 01:10:16,693
<i>Ann.</i>

955
01:10:19,446 --> 01:10:20,947
<i>Are you drunk, Henry?</i>

956
01:10:21,865 --> 01:10:23,116
<i>Whoa.</i>

957
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:24,784
<i>I'm not that drunk.</i>

958
01:10:24,868 --> 01:10:27,037
<i>Let's waltz.</i>

959
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:29,873
<i>But I'll kill my voice out here.</i>

960
01:10:29,956 --> 01:10:32,000
<i>Henry, a storm is rolling in.</i>

961
01:10:32,083 --> 01:10:33,311
<i>I'm well aware of that, my dear.</i>

962
01:10:33,335 --> 01:10:35,170
<i>Let's waltz in the storm!</i>

963
01:10:35,253 --> 01:10:37,231
<i>A storm is rolling in,
a storm is rolling in</i>

964
01:10:37,255 --> 01:10:40,675
<i>A storm is rolling in, a storm
is rolling in</i>

965
01:10:40,759 --> 01:10:42,010
<i>Henry, you're drunk</i>

966
01:10:42,093 --> 01:10:43,773
<i>-Henry, you're drunk
-A storm is rolling in</i>

967
01:10:43,803 --> 01:10:45,406
<i>-I'm not that drunk
-A storm is rolling in</i>

968
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:46,908
<i>I'm not that drunk</i>

969
01:10:46,932 --> 01:10:49,893
<i>Hey, where's Annette?
Where did she go?</i>

970
01:10:49,976 --> 01:10:52,896
<i>Annette's asleep,
she's safe below</i>

971
01:10:52,979 --> 01:10:56,316
<i>Henry, you're not the man I know</i>

972
01:10:56,399 --> 01:10:57,651
<i>I'm not that drunk</i>

973
01:10:57,734 --> 01:11:01,029
<i>I'm not that drunk,
I'm not that drunk</i>

974
01:11:01,112 --> 01:11:02,614
<i>-I'm not that drunk
-Henry,</i>

975
01:11:02,697 --> 01:11:04,366
<i>you're not the man I know.</i>

976
01:11:04,449 --> 01:11:06,618
<i>We'll catch our death
in this rain.</i>

977
01:11:06,701 --> 01:11:08,662
<i>Henry, stop fooling around.</i>

978
01:11:08,745 --> 01:11:11,748
<i>We could slip, we could drown.</i>

979
01:11:13,667 --> 01:11:14,876
<i>Whoa!</i>

980
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,337
<i>Henry, don't fool around</i>

981
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:20,757
<i>There's a storm, settle down</i>

982
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:23,677
<i>Careful, hey! What if we fell?</i>

983
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,721
<i>No one could survive
these swells -</i>

984
01:11:26,805 --> 01:11:29,975
<i>You're quite drunk,
let's calm down</i>

985
01:11:30,058 --> 01:11:33,061
<i>When we're safe,
you can be a clown</i>

986
01:11:33,144 --> 01:11:36,314
<i>What has gotten into you?</i>

987
01:11:36,398 --> 01:11:39,484
<i>What has gotten into you?</i>

988
01:11:40,527 --> 01:11:44,114
<i>With this storm and this sea</i>

989
01:11:44,197 --> 01:11:47,409
<i>I feel scared, look at me</i>

990
01:11:47,492 --> 01:11:50,120
<i>Comfort me, hold me tight</i>

991
01:11:50,203 --> 01:11:53,999
<i>Oh, what a terrible,
terrible night</i>

992
01:11:57,585 --> 01:11:59,337
<i>My voice, Henry.</i>

993
01:11:59,421 --> 01:12:01,464
<i>Is nothing sacred to you?</i>

994
01:12:01,548 --> 01:12:03,925
<i>Oh, God knows
everything is to you.</i>

995
01:12:04,009 --> 01:12:05,301
<i>Always trumpeting values</i>

996
01:12:05,385 --> 01:12:07,220
<i>The sacred values</i>

997
01:12:07,303 --> 01:12:10,306
<i>And then dying, dying</i>

998
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:12,142
<i>Dying!</i>

999
01:12:12,225 --> 01:12:14,269
<i>And then bowing, bowing, bowing</i>

1000
01:12:23,111 --> 01:12:26,156
<i>Henry, stop it, stop it now!</i>

1001
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:29,409
<i>We're gonna fall, gonna die!</i>

1002
01:12:29,492 --> 01:12:32,078
<i>What has gotten into you?</i>

1003
01:12:32,162 --> 01:12:33,830
<i>Think of Annette!</i>

1004
01:12:44,299 --> 01:12:47,469
<i>Henry, help me! Pull me out!</i>

1005
01:12:47,552 --> 01:12:50,638
<i>Where are you? Help!</i>

1006
01:12:50,722 --> 01:12:54,017
<i>Henry, I'm almost out of air!</i>

1007
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:56,936
<i>There's so little I can do</i>

1008
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:59,814
<i>There's so little I can do</i>

1009
01:12:59,898 --> 01:13:03,151
<i>There's so little I can do</i>

1010
01:13:03,234 --> 01:13:06,279
<i>There's so little I can do</i>

1011
01:13:08,907 --> 01:13:11,993
<i>There's so little I can do</i>

1012
01:13:15,288 --> 01:13:19,459
<i>There's so little I can do.</i>

1013
01:14:18,268 --> 01:14:20,687
<i>We gotta go, gotta go, gotta go.</i>

1014
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:32,031
<i>We washed ashore</i>

1015
01:14:32,115 --> 01:14:34,617
<i>Annette</i>

1016
01:14:34,701 --> 01:14:39,247
<i>On some island</i>

1017
01:14:39,330 --> 01:14:44,085
<i>Somewhere</i>

1018
01:14:46,421 --> 01:14:52,594
<i>Your mother's gone, Annette</i>

1019
01:14:54,053 --> 01:15:01,019
<i>I'll take care of you</i>

1020
01:15:03,855 --> 01:15:10,528
<i>Help is on the way</i>

1021
01:15:10,612 --> 01:15:12,363
<i>Annette</i>

1022
01:15:13,239 --> 01:15:16,784
<i>Someone's heard</i>

1023
01:15:16,868 --> 01:15:23,041
<i>Our calls</i>

1024
01:15:23,124 --> 01:15:27,462
<i>In the meantime</i>

1025
01:15:27,545 --> 01:15:31,382
<i>Stars line up</i>

1026
01:15:32,508 --> 01:15:39,474
<i>They line up for you</i>

1027
01:16:44,872 --> 01:16:47,292
<i>Somehow I'm imagining
Annette is singing.</i>

1028
01:16:49,544 --> 01:16:52,547
<i>Just as the light of the moon</i>

1029
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:54,465
<i>lit her beautiful face.</i>

1030
01:16:55,591 --> 01:16:57,260
<i>How foolish.</i>

1031
01:16:59,137 --> 01:17:00,930
<i>How very foolish I can be.</i>

1032
01:17:04,350 --> 01:17:06,269
<i>Now, I can hear the...</i>

1033
01:17:06,352 --> 01:17:08,938
<i>stars laughing at me.</i>

1034
01:17:09,022 --> 01:17:11,649
<i>In the morning I'll be...</i>

1035
01:17:11,733 --> 01:17:14,360
<i>free of all these
hallucinations.</i>

1036
01:17:50,396 --> 01:17:55,068
<i>I will haunt you, Henry</i>

1037
01:17:56,402 --> 01:18:02,742
<i>For the rest of your life</i>

1038
01:18:02,825 --> 01:18:08,498
<i>Through Annette, I'll haunt you</i>

1039
01:18:08,581 --> 01:18:14,754
<i>Her voice will be my ghost</i>

1040
01:18:14,837 --> 01:18:19,550
<i>I am no longer love</i>

1041
01:18:19,634 --> 01:18:25,723
<i>I am now revenge</i>

1042
01:18:56,546 --> 01:19:01,467
<i>I will haunt you, Henry</i>

1043
01:19:01,551 --> 01:19:07,849
<i>I'll die day after day after day</i>

1044
01:19:07,932 --> 01:19:14,063
<i>I will haunt you, Henry</i>

1045
01:19:14,147 --> 01:19:20,987
<i>Night after night after night.</i>

1046
01:19:26,659 --> 01:19:28,286
<i>We are the police
and we have got</i>

1047
01:19:28,369 --> 01:19:30,121
<i>Some routine questions</i>

1048
01:19:30,204 --> 01:19:33,374
<i>You're not suspected, but
we have to ask some questions</i>

1049
01:19:33,458 --> 01:19:36,878
<i>It won't take long, how 'bout
some coffee with your questions?</i>

1050
01:19:36,961 --> 01:19:40,298
<i>It won't take long, we don't
have very many questions</i>

1051
01:19:40,381 --> 01:19:41,966
<i>Not many questions</i>

1052
01:19:42,049 --> 01:19:45,386
<i>Can you describe the night
and how your wife went missing?</i>

1053
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:48,014
<i>There was a storm and I looked
up and she was missing</i>

1054
01:19:48,097 --> 01:19:51,893
<i>And did you try at all
to dive in and to save her?</i>

1055
01:19:51,976 --> 01:19:55,563
<i>The sea was rough, and with
Annette, how could I save her?</i>

1056
01:19:55,646 --> 01:19:59,025
<i>The storm was very strong,
there was no way to save her</i>

1057
01:19:59,108 --> 01:20:02,570
<i>And anyway, I had Annette,
I had to save her</i>

1058
01:20:03,571 --> 01:20:04,864
<i>I had Annette.</i>

1059
01:20:04,947 --> 01:20:08,576
<i>We heard the rumors
that you're somewhat of a raver</i>

1060
01:20:08,659 --> 01:20:11,370
<i>Were there some problems
between you that made you waver?</i>

1061
01:20:11,454 --> 01:20:15,458
<i>That is an insult, I loved Ann,
was always faithful</i>

1062
01:20:15,541 --> 01:20:18,836
<i>How 'bout that comic piece in
which you said you killed her?</i>

1063
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:22,089
<i>Was that a prank or
something more, an aspiration?</i>

1064
01:20:22,173 --> 01:20:25,218
<i>Everybody knows my acts
are full of provocation</i>

1065
01:20:25,301 --> 01:20:29,055
<i>Well, that 'bout wraps it up,
we sure are grateful, Henry</i>

1066
01:20:29,138 --> 01:20:32,600
<i>It now seems clear to us
there is no guilty party</i>

1067
01:20:32,683 --> 01:20:35,895
<i>It was an act of God,
that is our firm conclusion</i>

1068
01:20:35,978 --> 01:20:37,355
<i>It was an act of God</i>

1069
01:20:37,438 --> 01:20:39,232
<i>And pardon the intrusion.</i>

1070
01:20:45,530 --> 01:20:47,031
<i>Yeah, that's him.</i>

1071
01:21:01,587 --> 01:21:05,675
<i>Sure, I've sinned
in all your eyes</i>

1072
01:21:05,758 --> 01:21:10,846
<i>But one thing you cannot deny is</i>

1073
01:21:10,930 --> 01:21:15,351
<i>I'm a good father,
I'm a good father</i>

1074
01:21:15,434 --> 01:21:18,354
<i>I'm a good father, am I?</i>

1075
01:21:19,730 --> 01:21:23,609
<i>My Annette will ask someday</i>

1076
01:21:23,693 --> 01:21:26,529
<i>- "Where is my mother?"
- Mommy! Daddy!</i>

1077
01:21:26,612 --> 01:21:28,948
<i>I will say that</i>

1078
01:21:29,031 --> 01:21:31,033
<i>I'm a good father</i>

1079
01:21:31,117 --> 01:21:34,996
<i>I'm a good father,
I'm a good father</i>

1080
01:21:35,079 --> 01:21:36,914
<i>But she's gone</i>

1081
01:21:37,707 --> 01:21:40,126
<i>I'm a good father</i>

1082
01:21:40,209 --> 01:21:42,420
<i>Mother and father</i>

1083
01:21:42,503 --> 01:21:45,715
<i>I'm a good father, am I?</i>

1084
01:22:00,313 --> 01:22:01,939
<i>Hi, Consuelo.</i>

1085
01:22:02,023 --> 01:22:03,899
<i>How's my Baby Annette?</i>

1086
01:22:03,983 --> 01:22:06,319
<i>Much better. No more fever.</i>

1087
01:22:06,402 --> 01:22:09,238
<i>Oh, thank you so much.</i>

1088
01:22:09,322 --> 01:22:10,990
<i>You're welcome, Mr. McHenry.</i>

1089
01:22:12,491 --> 01:22:14,577
<i>Uh... see you tomorrow?</i>

1090
01:22:14,660 --> 01:22:16,412
<i>Yes. Have a good evening.</i>

1091
01:22:16,495 --> 01:22:17,496
<i>You, too.</i>

1092
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:19,373
<i>Bye-bye, my love.</i>

1093
01:22:27,214 --> 01:22:29,050
<i>Look at what I got for you.</i>

1094
01:22:30,384 --> 01:22:32,678
<i>What is it?</i>

1095
01:22:33,638 --> 01:22:35,431
<i>What is it, Annette?</i>

1096
01:22:37,224 --> 01:22:40,186
<i>What is that?</i>

1097
01:22:40,269 --> 01:22:41,854
<i>Look at that.</i>

1098
01:22:44,357 --> 01:22:45,858
<i>Are you excited?</i>

1099
01:22:56,661 --> 01:22:58,245
<i>Annette,
isn't it magical that...</i>

1100
01:23:12,718 --> 01:23:14,220
<i>Unbelievable</i>

1101
01:23:15,429 --> 01:23:16,681
<i>Amazing</i>

1102
01:23:17,765 --> 01:23:19,892
<i>It's really happening</i>

1103
01:23:19,975 --> 01:23:22,520
<i>She sings</i>

1104
01:23:22,603 --> 01:23:24,605
<i>She's a miracle</i>

1105
01:23:26,023 --> 01:23:29,568
<i>When the light shines on her</i>

1106
01:23:29,652 --> 01:23:31,404
<i>Astounding</i>

1107
01:23:31,487 --> 01:23:34,240
<i>Unbelievable</i>

1108
01:23:34,323 --> 01:23:36,575
<i>Amazing</i>

1109
01:23:40,413 --> 01:23:43,082
<i>It's really happening</i>

1110
01:23:44,667 --> 01:23:47,878
<i>It's really happening</i>

1111
01:23:47,962 --> 01:23:50,715
<i>To me.</i>

1112
01:24:16,407 --> 01:24:19,744
<i>It's a fast-changing world.</i>

1113
01:24:19,827 --> 01:24:24,415
<i>And I am now the conductor
of the city's finest orchestra.</i>

1114
01:24:24,498 --> 01:24:26,292
<i>No longer
the self-deprecating accompanist</i>

1115
01:24:26,375 --> 01:24:28,210
<i>from such a short while ago.</i>

1116
01:24:30,337 --> 01:24:32,339
<i>Ann would be proud of me.</i>

1117
01:24:34,133 --> 01:24:38,554
<i>I do have my suspicions, though,
about why she isn't alive.</i>

1118
01:24:41,348 --> 01:24:42,975
<i>And doubts, too,</i>

1119
01:24:43,058 --> 01:24:45,895
<i>about something else, but...</i>

1120
01:24:45,978 --> 01:24:47,271
<i>Excuse me a minute.</i>

1121
01:25:19,970 --> 01:25:24,141
<i>Henry has invited me
to his place tomorrow...</i>

1122
01:25:24,225 --> 01:25:27,812
<i>...to discuss a matter that he
says concerns Annette and Ann.</i>

1123
01:25:32,191 --> 01:25:35,486
<i>As awkward as it is
for me to attend,</i>

1124
01:25:35,569 --> 01:25:39,406
<i>anything that concerns Ann
and the future of Annette</i>

1125
01:25:39,490 --> 01:25:41,784
<i>is something that concerns me.</i>

1126
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:44,829
<i>Excuse me one more time.</i>

1127
01:26:01,053 --> 01:26:03,055
<i>My love for Ann has never died.</i>

1128
01:26:05,766 --> 01:26:08,602
<i>Neither has my regret</i>

1129
01:26:08,686 --> 01:26:11,021
<i>that our affair</i>

1130
01:26:11,105 --> 01:26:12,690
<i>was only an affair.</i>

1131
01:26:15,276 --> 01:26:18,946
<i>I had been hoping for so long.</i>

1132
01:26:19,029 --> 01:26:22,867
<i>Then at a time when she was in
despair, we started an affair.</i>

1133
01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:25,452
<i>But the very next week,
she met Henry.</i>

1134
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:28,080
<i>That was the end of it,
the end of me.</i>

1135
01:26:28,163 --> 01:26:29,832
<i>I'll always regret that.</i>

1136
01:26:29,915 --> 01:26:33,419
<i>I deeply miss her...
Her warmth, her voice.</i>

1137
01:26:33,502 --> 01:26:35,212
<i>I miss Ann. Excuse me.</i>

1138
01:27:08,787 --> 01:27:10,122
<i>Thank you.</i>

1139
01:27:22,384 --> 01:27:23,469
<i>Hey, Henry.</i>

1140
01:27:23,552 --> 01:27:25,971
<i>Thanks for coming by</i>

1141
01:27:26,055 --> 01:27:28,807
<i>My Conductor friend</i>

1142
01:27:28,891 --> 01:27:31,435
<i>Got something to show you</i>

1143
01:27:31,518 --> 01:27:34,104
<i>That will blow your mind</i>

1144
01:27:34,188 --> 01:27:36,774
<i>Follow me upstairs</i>

1145
01:27:36,857 --> 01:27:39,443
<i>As a friend of mine</i>

1146
01:27:39,526 --> 01:27:41,862
<i>You deserve to see this</i>

1147
01:27:41,946 --> 01:27:44,823
<i>It will blow your mind</i>

1148
01:27:44,907 --> 01:27:47,534
<i>Careful with the stairs</i>

1149
01:27:47,618 --> 01:27:50,037
<i>Have no fear, my friend</i>

1150
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:52,873
<i>I'm not gonna play</i>

1151
01:27:52,957 --> 01:27:54,917
<i>Any trick of mine</i>

1152
01:28:04,843 --> 01:28:07,221
<i>- Henry, what are you do...
- Shh.</i>

1153
01:28:33,622 --> 01:28:34,790
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

1154
01:28:34,873 --> 01:28:36,208
<i>I just can't believe it.</i>

1155
01:28:36,291 --> 01:28:38,460
<i>- Can you explain it?
- I can't explain it.</i>

1156
01:28:38,544 --> 01:28:41,296
<i>- Is it really happening?
- I don't know what to think.</i>

1157
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:42,798
<i>Is it really happening?</i>

1158
01:28:42,881 --> 01:28:44,508
<i>I really don't know
what to think.</i>

1159
01:28:44,591 --> 01:28:46,343
<i>To us?</i>

1160
01:28:46,427 --> 01:28:48,470
<i>- How 'bout a drink?
- I need a drink.</i>

1161
01:28:49,638 --> 01:28:50,848
<i>A strong drink.</i>

1162
01:28:50,931 --> 01:28:54,226
<i>Here's my plan,
my sweet Conductor</i>

1163
01:28:54,309 --> 01:28:56,895
<i>We three travel round the world</i>

1164
01:28:56,979 --> 01:28:59,398
<i>She performs with you conducting</i>

1165
01:28:59,481 --> 01:29:02,151
<i>Backing her around the world</i>

1166
01:29:02,234 --> 01:29:04,862
<i>All the world
deserves to see this</i>

1167
01:29:04,945 --> 01:29:07,489
<i>It's our moral duty, right?</i>

1168
01:29:07,573 --> 01:29:10,325
<i>Well, what do you think,
Conductor?</i>

1169
01:29:10,409 --> 01:29:13,579
<i>Am I wrong or am I right?</i>

1170
01:29:13,662 --> 01:29:16,206
<i>If you would consent</i>

1171
01:29:16,290 --> 01:29:18,751
<i>To be there for her</i>

1172
01:29:18,834 --> 01:29:21,545
<i>Your fame will grow greater</i>

1173
01:29:21,628 --> 01:29:24,131
<i>Two hundred percent</i>

1174
01:29:24,214 --> 01:29:26,759
<i>We would tour the world</i>

1175
01:29:26,842 --> 01:29:29,511
<i>Show her to the world</i>

1176
01:29:29,595 --> 01:29:32,097
<i>Millions would go wild</i>

1177
01:29:32,181 --> 01:29:34,808
<i>Cherishing the child</i>

1178
01:29:34,892 --> 01:29:37,436
<i>This is really exploitation.</i>

1179
01:29:37,519 --> 01:29:39,605
<i>-No, not really
-Sure it is.</i>

1180
01:29:39,688 --> 01:29:42,274
<i>This is really exploitation.</i>

1181
01:29:42,357 --> 01:29:44,777
<i>-No, not really
-Sure it is.</i>

1182
01:29:44,860 --> 01:29:47,654
<i>You know what my future
looks like</i>

1183
01:29:47,738 --> 01:29:50,282
<i>From a money point of view</i>

1184
01:29:50,365 --> 01:29:52,868
<i>With the income from performance</i>

1185
01:29:52,951 --> 01:29:56,038
<i>She could have a future, too</i>

1186
01:29:56,121 --> 01:29:58,082
<i>- You're exploiting her, Henry.
- No, not really.</i>

1187
01:29:58,165 --> 01:30:01,168
<i>- You're exploiting Annette.
- No, not really!</i>

1188
01:30:01,251 --> 01:30:03,712
<i>Please make up your mind</i>

1189
01:30:03,796 --> 01:30:06,548
<i>Please make up your mind</i>

1190
01:30:06,632 --> 01:30:08,926
<i>Please, Conductor friend</i>

1191
01:30:09,009 --> 01:30:11,136
<i>We cannot waste time.</i>

1192
01:30:43,335 --> 01:30:45,754
<i>I have the same dream</i>

1193
01:30:47,005 --> 01:30:48,674
<i>Every night</i>

1194
01:30:50,092 --> 01:30:52,594
<i>Every night the same dream</i>

1195
01:30:56,473 --> 01:30:58,475
<i>Adrift</i>

1196
01:30:59,768 --> 01:31:01,854
<i>On an angry sea</i>

1197
01:31:03,355 --> 01:31:06,859
<i>And in a moment of rage</i>

1198
01:31:06,942 --> 01:31:08,443
<i>And stupidity</i>

1199
01:31:09,695 --> 01:31:11,363
<i>I kill</i>

1200
01:31:12,656 --> 01:31:14,658
<i>The one I love</i>

1201
01:31:16,869 --> 01:31:20,873
<i>Ann, forgive me</i>

1202
01:31:23,458 --> 01:31:24,710
<i>Ann</i>

1203
01:31:26,712 --> 01:31:28,547
<i>I beg you</i>

1204
01:31:30,007 --> 01:31:31,592
<i>Ann</i>

1205
01:31:33,010 --> 01:31:39,099
<i>Forgive me</i>

1206
01:31:49,193 --> 01:31:52,738
<i>I have the same dream</i>

1207
01:31:52,821 --> 01:31:54,823
<i>Every night</i>

1208
01:31:56,116 --> 01:31:59,286
<i>Every night the same dream</i>

1209
01:32:02,331 --> 01:32:04,333
<i>She's here</i>

1210
01:32:05,584 --> 01:32:09,004
<i>Lying by my side</i>

1211
01:32:09,087 --> 01:32:12,382
<i>An exercise</i>

1212
01:32:12,466 --> 01:32:15,636
<i>In futility</i>

1213
01:32:15,719 --> 01:32:18,722
<i>Did I kill</i>

1214
01:32:18,805 --> 01:32:22,226
<i>The one I love?</i>

1215
01:32:22,309 --> 01:32:27,564
<i>There's no forgiveness</i>

1216
01:32:29,066 --> 01:32:30,817
<i>Ann</i>

1217
01:32:32,152 --> 01:32:35,364
<i>I beg you</i>

1218
01:32:35,447 --> 01:32:38,617
<i>There's no</i>

1219
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:41,328
<i>Forgiveness...</i>

1220
01:33:42,389 --> 01:33:45,559
<i>You've read about her</i>

1221
01:33:45,642 --> 01:33:48,645
<i>You've heard about her</i>

1222
01:33:48,729 --> 01:33:51,356
<i>But nothing will have
prepared you for</i>

1223
01:33:51,440 --> 01:33:54,693
<i>What you're about to see</i>

1224
01:33:55,610 --> 01:33:57,863
<i>Nothing will have prepared you</i>

1225
01:33:57,946 --> 01:34:01,616
<i>For what you're
about to see and hear</i>

1226
01:34:02,617 --> 01:34:04,619
<i>Tonight</i>

1227
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:08,623
<i>Tonight</i>

1228
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,378
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome</i>

1229
01:34:13,462 --> 01:34:16,715
<i>To the premiere performance of</i>

1230
01:34:16,798 --> 01:34:18,633
<i>Baby Annette</i>

1231
01:34:19,885 --> 01:34:22,721
<i>Baby Annette</i>

1232
01:34:23,555 --> 01:34:25,599
<i>I am Henry McHenry</i>

1233
01:34:27,017 --> 01:34:29,519
<i>I am Henry McHenry</i>

1234
01:34:38,153 --> 01:34:39,696
<i>Cynics among you may doubt</i>

1235
01:34:39,780 --> 01:34:41,865
<i>that what you're about to see
is real.</i>

1236
01:34:43,408 --> 01:34:46,620
<i>That it is not faked
in some way.</i>

1237
01:34:46,703 --> 01:34:48,538
<i>Let me assure you it is real.</i>

1238
01:34:49,664 --> 01:34:52,501
<i>Annette is a miracle.</i>

1239
01:34:54,795 --> 01:34:56,797
<i>Miracles do exist.</i>

1240
01:34:57,923 --> 01:35:01,301
<i>Without further ado</i>

1241
01:35:01,385 --> 01:35:04,471
<i>I introduce to you</i>

1242
01:35:04,554 --> 01:35:06,223
<i>Baby Annette</i>

1243
01:35:07,808 --> 01:35:10,060
<i>Baby Annette</i>

1244
01:37:31,618 --> 01:37:32,911
<i>We love you, Annette!</i>

1245
01:37:32,994 --> 01:37:36,164
<i>- Exploitation!
- It's exploitation.</i>

1246
01:37:38,708 --> 01:37:39,709
<i>I love you!</i>

1247
01:37:39,793 --> 01:37:42,546
<i>- Annette!
- We love you!</i>

1248
01:37:42,629 --> 01:37:44,130
<i>Annette!</i>

1249
01:37:44,214 --> 01:37:46,049
<i>We love you, Annette!</i>

1250
01:37:49,803 --> 01:37:53,056
<i>Annette and me</i>

1251
01:37:53,139 --> 01:37:56,434
<i>And The Conductor are three</i>

1252
01:37:56,518 --> 01:37:57,978
<i>We're traveling round the world</i>

1253
01:37:58,061 --> 01:37:59,563
<i>We're traveling round the world</i>

1254

<i>No!</i>

1370
01:46:02,170 --> 01:46:06,424
<i>No, Henry,
I wrote that song for Ann.</i>

1371
01:46:06,507 --> 01:46:07,842
<i>What?</i>

1372
01:46:07,925 --> 01:46:11,012
<i>So I had every right to teach it
to my star pupil, Annette.</i>

1373
01:46:11,095 --> 01:46:13,514
<i>Yeah, bullshit.</i>

1374
01:46:13,598 --> 01:46:17,226
<i>You'd think you were her father</i>

1375

<i>You'd think you were her father</i>

1376

<i>You'd think you were her father</i>

1377

<i>This can't be true,
this can't be true</i>

1380
01:46:32,241 --> 01:46:33,659
<i>Sorry, Henry.</i>

1381
01:46:33,743 --> 01:46:36,454
<i>You see, before you came along,
Ann and I...</i>

1382
01:46:36,537 --> 01:46:38,081
<i>This can't be true</i>

1383
01:46:38,164 --> 01:46:40,083
<i>Could this be true?</i>

1384
01:46:40,166 --> 01:46:44,796
<i>No one must know this
or I'll lose my daughter</i>

1385

1387
01:47:03,439 --> 01:47:05,733
<i>Well, let's put Annette to bed</i>

1388
01:47:05,817 --> 01:47:08,528
<i>and then go by the pool
and talk it over, okay?</i>

1389
01:47:40,810 --> 01:47:42,478
<i>Good night, Annette.</i>

1390
01:48:10,673 --> 01:48:12,175
<i>You see, my friend...</i>

1391
01:48:17,305 --> 01:48:20,308
<i>Henry, don't fool around</i>

1392
01:48:21,559 --> 01:48:23,561
<i>The water must be freezing.</i>

1393
01:48:23,644 --> 01:48:25,354
<i>You wouldn't want me to...</i>

1394
01:48:25,438 --> 01:48:28,149
<i>drown, would you?</i>

1395
01:48:28,232 --> 01:48:29,483
<i>I don't know.</i>

1396
01:48:31,027 --> 01:48:32,528
<i>What was I about to say?</i>

1397
01:48:32,612 --> 01:48:34,572
<i>Shall we talk</i>

1398
01:48:34,655 --> 01:48:36,616
<i>As you'd asked?</i>

1399
01:48:36,699 --> 01:48:40,828
<i>I can't stay,
can you make it fast?</i>

1400
01:48:40,912 --> 01:48:44,582
<i>Not to be impolite</i>

1401
01:48:44,665 --> 01:48:48,294
<i>But it's been a long, long night</i>

1402
01:48:48,377 --> 01:48:51,047
<i>Hey! Henry, no!</i>

1403
01:48:51,130 --> 01:48:53,549
<i>Stop fooling around.</i>

1404
01:48:53,633 --> 01:48:55,384
<i>You're quite drunk</i>

1405
01:48:55,468 --> 01:48:57,470
<i>Let's both sit down</i>

1406
01:48:57,553 --> 01:49:00,806
<i>What is it you need to say?</i>

1407
01:49:01,766 --> 01:49:03,267
<i>Sit down, Henry</i>

1408
01:49:03,351 --> 01:49:04,727
<i>Oh! Watch it! Hey!</i>

1409
01:49:04,810 --> 01:49:06,479
<i>Shh!</i>

1410
01:49:06,562 --> 01:49:08,272
<i>Okay, this isn't funny anymore.</i>

1411
01:49:08,356 --> 01:49:10,274
<i>- Not the least bit funny anymore!
- Shh!</i>

1412
01:49:10,358 --> 01:49:11,543
<i>- Get your hands off me.

you're safe here, yes?</i>

02:06:46,746 --> 02:06:48,748
<i>No. No, I can't.</i>

1614
02:06:51,209 --> 02:06:55,213
<i>And you can't kill here,
can you?</i>

1615
02:06:57,424 --> 02:07:01,011
<i>It was a joke.</i>

1616
02:07:01,094 --> 02:07:03,346

1622
02:07:17,986 --> 02:07:20,989

you have nothing to love.</i>

1623
02:07:22,449 --> 02:07:24,117

1624
02:07:25,660 --> 02:07:26,911
<i>No.</i>

1625
02:07:26,995 --> 02:07:28,330

<i>We don't have long.</i>

1628
02:07:56,399 --> 02:08:00,612
<i>I'll sing these words to you</i>

1629
02:08:00,695 --> 02:08:04,949
<i>I hope that they'll ring true</i>

1630
02:08:05,033 --> 02:08:07,869
<i>They're not some magic chimes</i>

1631
02:08:09,287 --> 02:08:11,956
<i>To cover up my crimes</i>

1632
02:08:13,458 --> 02:08:15,460
<i>Annette, of this I'm sure</i>

1633
02:08:15,543 --> 02:08:18,338
<i>Imagination's strong</i>

1634
02:08:18,421 --> 02:08:20,590
<i>And reason's song</i>

1635
02:08:20,673 --> 02:08:22,842
<i>Is weak and thin</i>

1636
02:08:22,926 --> 02:08:24,719
<i>We don't have long</i>

1637
02:08:26,304 --> 02:08:28,807
<i>I stood upon a cliff</i>

1638
02:08:30,642 --> 02:08:33,269
<i>A deep abyss below</i>

1639
02:08:34,854 --> 02:08:37,315
<i>Compelled to look, I tried</i>

1640
02:08:37,399 --> 02:08:39,442
<i>To fight it off</i>

1641
02:08:39,526 --> 02:08:42,779
<i>God knows I tried</i>

1642
02:08:42,862 --> 02:08:45,448
<i>This horrid urge to look below</i>

1643
02:08:45,532 --> 02:08:48,118
<i>But half horrified</i>

1644
02:08:48,201 --> 02:08:50,286
<i>And half relieved</i>

1645
02:08:50,370 --> 02:08:52,455
<i>I cast my eyes</i>

1646
02:08:52,539 --> 02:08:54,541
<i>Toward the abyss</i>

1647
02:08:54,624 --> 02:08:56,626
<i>The dark abyss</i>

1648
02:09:04,217 --> 02:09:08,388
<i>I heard a ringing in my ears</i>

1649
02:09:08,471 --> 02:09:12,684
<i>I knew my death knell's
ugly sound</i>

1650
02:09:12,767 --> 02:09:17,105
<i>The overbearing urge to gaze</i>

1651
02:09:17,188 --> 02:09:21,317
<i>Into the deep abyss, the haze</i>

1652
02:09:21,401 --> 02:09:24,112
<i>So strong the yearning
for the fall</i>

1653
02:09:24,195 --> 02:09:26,865
<i>Imagination's strong</i>

1654
02:09:26,948 --> 02:09:29,033
<i>And reason's song</i>

1655
02:09:29,117 --> 02:09:31,119
<i>Is weak and thin</i>

1656
02:09:31,202 --> 02:09:33,371
<i>We don't have long</i>

1657
02:09:33,455 --> 02:09:35,832
<i>I'll never sing again</i>

1658
02:09:35,915 --> 02:09:38,084
<i>Shunning all lights at night</i>

1659
02:09:38,168 --> 02:09:40,128
<i>I'll never sing again</i>

1660
02:09:40,211 --> 02:09:42,297
<i>Smashing every lamp I see</i>

1661
02:09:42,380 --> 02:09:44,424
<i>I'll never sing again</i>

1662
02:09:44,507 --> 02:09:46,718
<i>Living in full darkness</i>

1663
02:09:46,801 --> 02:09:50,346
<i>I'll never sing again</i>

1664
02:09:50,430 --> 02:09:53,057
<i>A vampire forever</i>

1665
02:09:53,141 --> 02:09:54,976
<i>Annette, no.</i>

1666
02:09:56,186 --> 02:09:57,353
<i>No, no.</i>

1667
02:09:58,521 --> 02:10:02,025
<i>Annette, Annette.</i>

1668
02:10:02,108 --> 02:10:03,109
<i>No.</i>

1669
02:10:05,028 --> 02:10:06,237
<i>I sang these words to you</i>

1670
02:10:06,321 --> 02:10:09,282
<i>Can I forgive
what you have done?</i>

1671
02:10:09,365 --> 02:10:10,825
<i>I hope, that they'd ring true</i>

1672
02:10:10,909 --> 02:10:13,703
<i>And will I ever forgive Mom?</i>

1673
02:10:13,786 --> 02:10:15,205
<i>Imagination is so strong</i>

1674
02:10:15,288 --> 02:10:17,290
<i>Her deadly poison, I became</i>

1675
02:10:17,373 --> 02:10:19,292
<i>And reason's song
is never strong</i>

1676
02:10:19,375 --> 02:10:21,753
<i>Merely a child to exploit</i>

1677
02:10:21,836 --> 02:10:24,339
<i>Imagination is so strong</i>

1678
02:10:24,422 --> 02:10:25,840
<i>Forgive you both?</i>

1679
02:10:25,924 --> 02:10:27,967
<i>-And reason's song
-Forget you both?</i>

1680
02:10:28,051 --> 02:10:29,886
<i>-So faint and shrill
-To take that oath?</i>

1681
02:10:29,969 --> 02:10:34,098
<i>-I stood above the deep abyss
-To take that oath?</i>

1682
02:10:34,182 --> 02:10:38,353
<i>Why should I now forgive?
Why should I now forget?</i>

1683
02:10:38,436 --> 02:10:42,607
<i>I can never forgive,
I can never forget</i>

1684
02:10:42,690 --> 02:10:45,485
<i>Both of you were using me
for your own ends</i>

1685
02:10:45,568 --> 02:10:47,070
<i>For your own ends</i>

1686
02:10:47,153 --> 02:10:48,863
<i>Not an ounce of shame</i>

1687
02:10:48,947 --> 02:10:51,574
<i>The two of you,
you're both to blame</i>

1688
02:10:51,658 --> 02:10:54,827
<i>I wish that both of you
were gone</i>

1689
02:10:54,911 --> 02:10:56,704
<i>Wish you were gone</i>

1690
02:10:56,788 --> 02:10:58,915
<i>-No, don't blame Ann
-Wish you were gone</i>

1691
02:10:58,998 --> 02:11:01,125
<i>-Annette, that's wrong
-Wish you were gone</i>

1692
02:11:01,209 --> 02:11:04,587
<i>-No, don't blame Ann
-Both of you gone</i>

1693
02:11:04,671 --> 02:11:06,714
<i>But is forgiveness the sole way</i>

1694
02:11:06,798 --> 02:11:08,758
<i>This horrid urge to look below</i>

1695
02:11:08,841 --> 02:11:10,843
<i>When all has gone so far astray</i>

1696
02:11:10,927 --> 02:11:12,804
<i>God knows I tried
to fight it off</i>

1697
02:11:12,887 --> 02:11:14,347
<i>-Extract the poison
-Half horrified</i>

1698
02:11:14,430 --> 02:11:16,266
<i>-From one's heart
-And half relieved</i>

1699
02:11:16,349 --> 02:11:18,309
<i>-And from one's soul
-I cast my eyes</i>

1700
02:11:18,393 --> 02:11:21,604
<i>-I can't be sure
-Down the abyss</i>

1701
02:11:21,688 --> 02:11:24,732
<i>Forgive the two of you or not</i>

1702
02:11:24,816 --> 02:11:26,985
<i>-I take this oath
-Sympathy for</i>

1703
02:11:27,068 --> 02:11:29,028
<i>- Forgive you both?
- The dark abyss</i>

1704
02:11:29,112 --> 02:11:31,239
<i>-I take this oath
-Sympathy for</i>

1705

1706

1707
02:11:35,577 --> 02:11:37,912
<i>- Or forget you both?
- Don't cast your eyes</i>

1708

-Down the abyss</i>

1709
02:11:40,415 --> 02:11:42,709
<i>-I must be strong
-Annette, please don't</i>

1710
02:11:44,043 --> 02:11:46,504
<i>Time's up.</i>

1711
02:11:47,672 --> 02:11:49,173
<i>No contact.</i>

1712
02:11:52,260 --> 02:11:57,849
<i>And now you have nothing to love</i>

1713
02:11:57,932 --> 02:11:59,642
<i>Why can't I love you?</i>

1714
02:11:59,726 --> 02:12:00,727
<i>Can't I love you?</i>

1715
02:12:00,810 --> 02:12:06,232
<i>Now you have nothing to love</i>

1716
02:12:06,316 --> 02:12:08,651
<i>Can't I love you, Annette?</i>

1717
02:12:08,735 --> 02:12:13,573
<i>No, not really, Daddy</i>

1718
02:12:13,656 --> 02:12:16,200
<i>It's sad but it's true</i>

1719
02:12:17,243 --> 02:12:22,832
<i>Now you having nothing to love</i>

1721
02:12:30,632 --> 02:12:32,759
<i>My Annette.</i>

1722
02:12:32,842 --> 02:12:35,178
<i>Never cast your eyes
down the abyss.</i>

1723
02:12:42,185 --> 02:12:45,021
