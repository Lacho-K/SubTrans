PART 1
LOVE AND AGONY

18
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,704
HOKKAIDO - DECEMBER

19
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:27,212
<i>That was some scream.</i>

20
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,551
Forgive me.

21
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:37,990
I was dreaming.

22
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,588
Dreaming?

23
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,293
Sounded like you
were being murdered.

24
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,192
I was...

25
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:54,533
about to be shot.

26
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,976
It's a recurring
nightmare of mine.

27
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:06,843
You see, I was convicted
as a war criminal

28
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,978
and sentenced to death.

29
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,188
Then why are you still alive?

30
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,557
My sentence was commuted
at the last minute.

31
00:03:17,764 --> 00:03:19,959
They realized
they had the wrong man.

32
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:24,526
But I went crazy
from the shock.

33
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,538
I spent a long time
in a US military hospital.

34
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,473
In the south?

35
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:33,976
In Okinawa.
But I'm better now.

36
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,978
They put me on a boat
ten days ago.

37
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:38,980
What ails you?

38
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,743
Idiocy.

39
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,022
They call it
epileptic dementia.

40
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:49,052
I had so many fits
that I eventually became an idiot.

41
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,119
An idiot?

42
00:03:56,869 --> 00:04:02,205
"Dostoyevsky wanted to portray
a genuinely good man.

43
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:06,845
It may seem ironic,
choosing a young idiot as his hero,

44
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:11,745
but in this world, goodness
and idiocy are often equated.

45
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:17,947
This story tells of the destruction
of a pure soul by a faithless world. "

46
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:30,229
Get up!
This man is sick!

47
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,928
That's all right.
Please, take your seat back.

48
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,040
Accept the favor, idiot!

49
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:47,478
I didn't mean it that way.

50
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,621
I say things like that a lot.

51
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:54,254
It's all right.
I don't mind.

52
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,686
Good.

53
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,573
Are you cold?

54
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,073
Yes, in fact, I am.

55
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:14,912
You're an odd one!

56
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:23,621
"Akama hadn't laughed in years.
He was the son of an old Sapporo family,

57
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:28,783
and his father's harsh discipline
had made him feel like a caged animal.

58
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:33,864
Oddly, he came to like Kameda,
who made him laugh heartily.

59
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:39,095
Akama told him about Taeko Nasu,
whom he'd met six months earlier.

60
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:44,800
One look at her had been enough
to release his pent-up passions.

61
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:49,141
He bought her a diamond ring
with money stolen from his father.

62
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,910
Enraged by this,
his father disowned him.

63
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:57,556
But now his father has died,
and Akama has come into his fortune.

64
00:05:57,757 --> 00:06:00,624
He's returning home to Sapporo,

65
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:05,855
where Kameda is also headed
to see Mr. Ono,

66
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:09,762
his only relative in the world. "

67
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,141
<i>Another snowstorm in Sapporo.</i>

68
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:28,247
Come on, follow me.

69
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,935
That's her - Taeko Nasu.

70
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:37,014
What do you think?
Isn't she amazing?

71
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,655
Very pretty.

72
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,027
But -

73
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,857
But what?

74
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:50,969
When I look at her face,
I feel a pain in my chest.

75
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,098
Why?

76
00:07:55,041 --> 00:08:00,343
She seems very unhappy.

77
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,662
Why are you crying?

78
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:22,991
I don't know. I was just looking
at her picture, and -

79
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:38,209
You really are a strange one!

80
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:44,890
I get a peculiar feeling
looking at you.

81
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,629
A tender feeling,
like I'm looking at a newborn lamb.

82
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,101
Well, I'm off.

83
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:06,506
The world's full of wolves.
Be careful.

84
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:25,095
<i>Kameda wept upon seeing
Taeko Nasu's picture.</i>

85
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:28,267
<i>She was, however,
a woman of ill repute.</i>

86
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:30,298
<i>Rumor had it</i>

87
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,597
<i>that she'd been Tohata's
mistress since childhood.</i>

88
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:36,001
<i>Fearing now for his reputation,</i>

89
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,939
<i>he has offered a dowry
of 600,000 yen to marry her off.</i>

90
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:43,274
<i>Unbeknownst to Kameda,
her shadow now falls upon</i>

91
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:46,007
<i>his destination,
the Ono residence.</i>

92
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:57,057
<i>Dear, what do you plan
to do about Kameda?</i>

93
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,699
Plan to do? Well...

94
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:06,431
he's coming all this way
in need of our help.

95
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,608
I'll try to find him work.

96
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:15,111
And Kayama has rooms for rent.
He can lodge there.

97
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,750
- Is that all?
- What do you mean?

98
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,385
You know,
your recent little tricks.

99
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,919
What's that supposed to mean?

100
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,991
I mean all your secrets
and funny business.

101
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,362
All those meetings with Tohata.

102
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:35,728
He may indeed
have a lot of influence,

103
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:38,199
but forcing his mistress
onto Kayama -

104
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,736
You don't understand.
It's in Kayama's best interest.

105
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,641
I'm glad I don't understand.

106
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:49,074
But any man who accepts
such a dirty deal isn't welcome here.

107
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:52,375
- But -
- I'll discuss it no further.

108
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:56,248
Right now I want to talk
about the idiot.

109
00:10:56,455 --> 00:11:00,016
I don't like how you're taking
advantage of him.

110
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:04,526
"The army had reported
Kameda officially dead.

111
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:08,666
Kameda's father
had left him a large ranch,

112
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,859
which Ono sold through Kayama. "

113
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:29,616
"Kayama is now
about to marry Taeko Nasu

114
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:33,222
in exchange for the 600,000 yen.

115
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:37,658
He plays the scoundrel, but he's
really an unassertive coward,

116
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:42,266
as shown by the fact that he secretly
loves Ono's daughter Ayako. "

117
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,628
Good morning.

118
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,897
- Sleep well?
- Yes.

119
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,607
Am I intruding?
- Not at all.

120
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:56,805
I was just listening
to Kayama's views on life.

121
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:15,223
Taeko's birthday party is tomorrow.
Don't forget.

122
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:16,761
I know, sir.

123
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:18,459
That's good.

124
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:22,107
Mr. Tohata and I
were able to convince her

125
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:26,005
to give you
her answer at the party.

126
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,772
You'd better be there.

127
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,278
I understand.

128
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,912
Knock first!

129
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,316
Why? Discussing something
I shouldn't hear?

130
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:39,088
Mr. Kameda, lunch is ready.

131
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,551
"Ayako - straight-laced
and strong-willed, like her mother.

132
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,698
So straight-laced at times
that she turns mean. "

133
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,806
What would you say
if all this were yours?

134
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,409
- Mine?
- Would you be happy?

135
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,170
Yes, of course.

136
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,910
These cows may well be yours.

137
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,178
I'm afraid I don't understand.

138
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,991
What a beautiful path!

139
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:28,137
What's wrong?
Why do you look at me like that?

140
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,777
Somehow I just can't
believe you're ill.

141
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,179
I wish I weren't.

142
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,582
But I do behave oddly, don't I?

143
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,117
No, it's all right.
I don't mind.

144
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,382
People always laugh at me.

145
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:49,686
I can tell I'm odd,
but I'm not sure how.

146
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,636
Tell me, what are you like?

147
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,605
I want to know more about you.

148
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:04,971
What did you do
before the war?

149
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,805
- Well -
- You'd rather not say?

150
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,947
It's not that.

151
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:13,676
I remember the day
my life was spared,

152
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:18,380
but everything before that feels
like it happened to someone else.

153
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:21,719
Then tell me that story.

154
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:27,629
How did it feel when you
were facing certain death?

155
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:33,962
Everyone in the world

156
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:38,433
suddenly seemed so dear to me.

157
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,236
Everyone in the world?

158
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:45,175
Each and every person
I'd ever known.

159
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,175
Everyone I'd ever
passed on the street.

160
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,821
And not just people -

161
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:55,893
the puppy I'd thrown
a rock at as a child.

162
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:01,998
Why hadn't I been kinder?

163
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,961
To the puppy?

164
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:09,435
No, everyone!

165
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:15,636
I told myself
that if I were spared...

166
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:23,485
I would be kinder
and more considerate to everyone.

167
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:29,556
But I knew all was lost.
They were sure to execute me.

168
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:32,922
That thought alone...

169
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:40,538
was so unbearable
that it drove me mad.

170
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,923
Where on earth have you been?

171
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:07,259
Mr. Kayama's been waiting
to take you home.

172
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:09,661
Really, where did you go?

173
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,236
Why even ask?
She won't answer just to spite us.

174
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:20,605
Be careful.

175
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,612
She'll never admit it,

176
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,479
but she's extremely
proud of her looks.

177
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:31,019
That's why she's
so selfish and mean.

178
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,316
See that?

179
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:39,987
See how she glares at me?
Isn't her simmering rage becoming?

180
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,393
Yes, quite.

181
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:46,997
I felt the same way
when I saw Taeko Nasu.

182
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:49,174
She's also very beautiful.

183
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,401
Goodness!
Where did you see her?

184
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:55,910
I saw her portrait
in a photo studio near the station.

185
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,514
I must see it!

186
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:02,281
Say what you will.
I'm just curious.

187
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:04,353
I'd like to see it too.

188
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:06,387
I have no urge whatsoever.

189
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,283
I wonder.

190
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,258
But it's about time
I spoke to Mr. Kayama.

191
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:13,624
Would you call him?
He's in the study.

192
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:14,856
Mother!

193
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:19,094
I'm sorry not to send the girls,
but I have my reasons.

194
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,935
Madam sent for me?

195
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:29,009
I wonder why.
Any idea?

196
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,106
Not really.

197
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:37,317
I mentioned Taeko Nasu,
and then -

198
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,213
What?

199
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,186
You know her?

200
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,897
How?

201
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,949
You must have overheard us.

202
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:08,585
Did you tell them
what Mr. Ono said to me?

203
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,015
No, I just -

204
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:12,190
Why did you do that?

205
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:16,225
I only mentioned
her picture near the station.

206
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,099
Well, what's done is done.
Let's go.

207
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,640
Listen, I need you
to do me a big favor.

208
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:40,007
Give Miss Ayako
a letter for me.

209
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,686
Am I imposing?

210
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:52,330
No, but why can't you
do it yourself?

211
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:54,590
You're about to go see her.

212
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,100
I have my reasons.

213
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:04,674
I can't let anyone see me do it.
Besides, it's urgent.

214
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,704
Please.

215
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,388
Mr. Kayama,
Mother's in the parlor.

216
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,702
Mr. Kameda,
shall we go upstairs?

217
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:42,142
Mr. Kayama asked me
to give you this.

218
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:06,464
I know I often tend
to be too blunt.

219
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:11,075
Don't be offended.
I just can't abide dishonesty.

220
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:15,141
We've become like family,

221
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:18,680
so I'll speak to you
like a mother.

222
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:23,117
You're planning to marry soon,
aren't you?

223
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,051
No, I -

224
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:27,950
No.

225
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,220
No?
Are you certain about that?

226
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,698
Well, I -

227
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,634
So you won't come out
and say it.

228
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:41,397
I must say, such secrecy
about something so joyous

229
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,802
does make one wonder.

230
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,170
That's all I had to say.

231
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:48,505
Now if you'll excuse me.

232
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:08,122
I just got raked over the coals
thanks to you.

233
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,631
- But I -
- No excuses!

234
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:14,095
What was her reply
to my letter?

235
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,672
<i>Mr. Kameda,
do you have a moment?</i>

236
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:24,544
I'm taking you home, right?
I'll wait outside.

237
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,266
Please read this.

238
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:54,212
Isn't that Mr. Kayama's letter?

239
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,404
Yes. Now read it.

240
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:59,413
Read it to me aloud.

241
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,381
That's for being his messenger.

242
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,901
"Tomorrow my fate
will be decided.

243
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:22,466
<i>If you still feel the friendship
for me that you once did,</i>

244
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,768
<i>simply say the word.</i>

245
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,845
Tell me to call
the whole thing off,

246
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:35,383
and I will gladly do so. "

247
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:43,959
He's entering into
a sham of a marriage,

248
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:48,599
all for the sake of power
and 600,000 yen.

249
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:54,633
Now he wants me
to tell him to call it off.

250
00:22:56,041 --> 00:23:00,000
He'll give up 600,000 yen
in return for my pledge of friendship.

251
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:06,709
If he'd resisted that enticement
from the outset,

252
00:23:06,918 --> 00:23:09,648
I might have given him
my friendship.

253
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:14,387
But I won't!
Give him his letter back.

254
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:19,792
Tell him I won't
barter my friendship.

255
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:25,594
I won't barter my friendship.

256
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:28,464
That's my answer.

257
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:31,335
What did she say?

258
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:37,841
What's this?
Didn't you give it to her?

259
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:42,145
Yes, I did.
Then she asked me to read it.

260
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:43,878
You read it?

261
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,421
Then she said
to give it back to you.

262
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:51,895
She herself told you to read it?

263
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,930
Yes, though I didn't want to.

264
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:59,163
What an idiot!

265
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:03,164
She'd never ask you to do that.

266
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,969
But she did.
I have her answer too.

267
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,270
Well?

268
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:09,637
"I won't barter my friendship. "

269
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:16,785
That's what she said
to tell you.

270
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:19,218
"I won't barter my friendship. "

271
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:56,418
KAYAMA INN

272
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:04,760
You again!

273
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,568
Telling your tales here too.

274
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,437
Have you no shame?

275
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:16,170
- You're one to talk.
- Takako!

276
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:22,017
Apologize to Mr. Kameda.

277
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:26,313
You're the one acting strangely.
That's why I sent for him.

278
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:29,224
So he told you everything,
the little -

279
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:33,488
What are you saying?
He just came in this minute.

280
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:38,029
I'm just worried about
what tonight holds in store.

281
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:41,694
Who but Kameda
would blab about that?

282
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,035
It was me.

283
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,107
That's right.

284
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:51,173
Tell me, why -

285
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,216
- Why marry another man's mistress?
- No.

286
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:56,944
She's not my concern.

287
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,521
It's you I'm worried about.

288
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:08,832
I want to know your feelings.
Why marry like this?

289
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,366
That's easy.

290
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,698
He's sick of being poor.
- You hush!

291
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:20,140
I can't stand it anymore!
You're a worthless fool!

292
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:23,041
What?
I dare you to repeat that.

293
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:26,011
I will.
Any number of times.

294
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:29,812
You're a worthless fool,
and so is she.

295
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:34,583
If you bring that woman here,
I'll leave home.

296
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:38,425
I couldn't care less.

297
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:44,668
Don't think it ends here.
There's more:

298
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:49,101
I wrote her and told her
everything I just told you.

299
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:51,365
You bitch!

300
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:54,409
Takako, run!

301
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:41,425
What is it? You look like
you've just seen a ghost.

302
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:47,227
Go announce me.

303
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:52,192
Wait!

304
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:55,134
Who are you going
to announce?

305
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,942
What a strange man!

306
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,078
Taeko Nasu.

307
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,450
How do you know me?

308
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,812
I...

309
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:16,288
Never mind.
Just announce me.

310
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,624
I'll marry her,
no matter what anyone says!

311
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,997
It's worth it just to see
that look on your face!

312
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,665
Miss Taeko Nasu is here.

313
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:43,579
Your entryway is freezing.
I let myself in.

314
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,953
Why on earth
do you look so pale?

315
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,070
Introduce me.

316
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:17,754
My younger sister.

317
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,685
Miss Taeko Nasu.

318
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,812
My mother.

319
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,811
Miss Taeko Nasu.

320
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:55,489
How do you do.
I'm glad you came.

321
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,356
Are you really?

322
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:04,526
How foolish of me.

323
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:07,666
I thought perhaps
a woman like me

324
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:12,502
wouldn't be welcome
in such a magnificent home.

325
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,938
I don't -

326
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:17,512
- Mother.
- Go make some tea.

327
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,849
Might I have a seat as well?

328
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:29,254
Please do.

329
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:39,196
Don't be a nuisance!
We have visitors!

330
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:46,033
My father.

331
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:47,871
Miss Taeko Nasu.

332
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:51,581
Jumpei Kayama...

333
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:56,379
a former soldier,
dishonorably discharged.

334
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:04,857
Fifty years old,
with nothing to show for it.

335
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:10,094
Allow me to introduce Mr. Kameda,
a very interesting fellow.

336
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,701
A relative of Mr. Ono's.

337
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:16,230
Forgive me.
I took you for a servant.

338
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,238
Not at all. I -

339
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,840
But how do you know me?

340
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:25,777
And why did you look
so surprised

341
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,282
when you saw me?

342
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:31,479
I felt...

343
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,648
as if I'd seen your eyes
somewhere before.

344
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,610
So it's true!

345
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:08,018
Which of you is my rival?

346
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,927
What are you doing here?

347
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,900
Who are all of you?

348
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:20,831
Him?

349
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,997
Who are you?

350
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:28,772
I'm Denkichi Akama,
and I'm rich as hell!

351
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:32,842
I can buy and sell the likes of you!
- Get out of here!

352
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:37,284
Are you really
going to marry him?

353
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:41,349
Now I remember you.

354
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:46,927
You gave me
a diamond ring once.

355
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:51,834
But why...

356
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:54,163
are you asking
these questions?

357
00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:00,972
How does my marriage
to that man concern you?

358
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:14,321
I'll pay you 600,000 yen
to give her up.

359
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,885
What are you saying?

360
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:19,591
You must be drunk.

361
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:22,728
700,000!
No, 800,000!

362
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:25,926
You fool!
Leave or I'll call the police!

363
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:28,738
Damn it!

364
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,970
One million yen!
By tonight.

365
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:36,542
Have one million ready
by 9:00 tonight.

366
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:47,217
So suddenly my price
has shot up by 400,000 yen?

367
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,350
Insolent bastard!

368
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,959
Father!

369
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:54,461
He's made you look
even more foolish!

370
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:55,859
You shut up!

371
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:59,764
I will not! Not while we're being
disgraced like this!

372
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:02,735
Either kick her out
or I will!

373
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:10,173
Bitch!

374
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,973
That's enough.

375
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:14,549
Stay out of this!
Let me go!

376
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:42,340
Stupid brother!

377
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:54,816
It's all right.

378
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:57,552
It's all right.

379
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:06,027
You should be ashamed!
That man is a lamb!

380
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,601
It was nothing.

381
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,708
Nothing at all.

382
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,883
Nothing at all.

383
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:41,168
You're not
that kind of person.

384
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,540
That's not who you are.

385
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:24,046
What he said
about me is true.

386
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:26,909
Can you forgive me?

387
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,191
Good-bye, Mr. Kayama.
I'll see you tonight.

388
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:44,424
Please come along too,
Mr. Kameda.

389
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:12,492
What's the matter?
Why are you neglecting your guests?

390
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:17,433
You look pale.

391
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,863
Do you have a fever?

392
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:26,973
Why else would I sit
bundled up here by myself?

393
00:37:27,478 --> 00:37:29,605
Why not rest a while?

394
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:33,940
There's something
I must tell you.

395
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,415
You're very kind,

396
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:38,646
but I prefer to keep drinking.

397
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:44,856
What's wrong, everyone?
Enjoy yourselves.

398
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,314
A Mr. Kameda has arrived.

399
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:20,482
Mr. Kameda.
He met Taeko at my place today.

400
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:24,718
I asked you to bring him.
Why didn't you?

401
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:26,487
Show him in.

402
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,592
Why him of all people?

403
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,099
You mean,
because he's an idiot?

404
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:38,766
I don't believe he is.

405
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:42,178
On the contrary...

406
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:47,540
he may be a good deal
more astute than either of you.

407
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:55,020
Especially at seeing
into another person's heart.

408
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:03,363
Now do you see?

409
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,831
How dare you!

410
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:07,469
I just -

411
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:10,333
Do you know how much
that vase was worth?

412
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:15,240
Let me ask you:
Didn't you give those vases to me?

413
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,340
Then let me do
with them as I wish.

414
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:29,482
I meant
to smash them anyway.

415
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:41,937
I won't bother
with introductions.

416
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:46,006
There's no one here
worthy of it.

417
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:56,645
What a thing to say!

418
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:04,751
Fortunately,
we've already met.

419
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:15,295
What's wrong?
Why are you staring like that?

420
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,605
Really...

421
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:27,946
what's the matter?

422
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:31,485
It just came to me.

423
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:37,592
I was sure I'd seen
eyes like yours before.

424
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:39,695
I just remembered where.

425
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:43,399
Eyes like mine?

426
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:47,865
How could I not remember?

427
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:53,771
What was the person like?

428
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:58,813
He and I faced
a firing squad together.

429
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,215
There were three posts.

430
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:13,396
We were to be shot
three at a time.

431
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:21,430
I was the fifth man
in the second row of prisoners.

432
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:25,475
I was to be
in the fourth group killed.

433
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:35,914
Just minutes before I was to die,
an order came down for a retrial.

434
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:40,314
I never dreamt
I would walk away alive.

435
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:48,494
And the man
with eyes like mine?

436
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:53,793
He was in the first group
to be shot.

437
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:03,647
He was barely 20 years old,

438
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:06,441
with the face of a boy.

439
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:14,184
He seemed as if in a trance,
tied there to that post.

440
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:19,451
Suddenly he began
to tremble.

441
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:28,134
He looked over at us,
his eyes filled with reproach.

442
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:37,670
They were the eyes of a man
who had suffered alone,

443
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:41,409
day and night,
for a very long time.

444
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:44,344
They seemed...

445
00:43:45,356 --> 00:43:51,056
to be crying out,
"Why must I suffer like this?"

446
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:59,163
What torment
he must have endured!

447
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:06,874
His eyes seemed ready
to burst and spew blood.

448
00:44:10,614 --> 00:44:15,517
I forgot that I too
was about to be shot.

449
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:18,347
I looked away.

450
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:31,067
At times...

451
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:37,364
your eyes are exactly like his.

452
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:42,236
And then?

453
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:46,740
What happened to him?

454
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:56,055
And then...

455
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,387
shots rang out.

456
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,491
I looked up.

457
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:11,670
There he was,
limp as a rag.

458
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:14,240
<i>That's enough!</i>

459
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:18,440
This is absurd!
This is supposed to be a birthday party!

460
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:20,139
Please be quiet.

461
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:26,151
Do you even care
that it's my birthday?

462
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:28,554
Mr. Kameda...

463
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,787
the fact is...

464
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:35,829
I've been asked
to marry Mr. Kayama.

465
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:41,401
I'm supposed to give him
my answer tonight.

466
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:44,463
Should I marry him or not?

467
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,307
What should I do?

468
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,068
- Taeko!
- This is outrageous!

469
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:50,269
I'll do whatever you say.

470
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:52,813
- Are you mad?
- This is serious!

471
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:56,543
Mr. Kameda,
please tell me.

472
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,689
Why are you asking him?
Who is he to you?

473
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,721
Don't you understand?

474
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:10,099
He trusted me
from the moment he met me.

475
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:16,932
That's why I trust him.

476
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:22,040
So tell me.

477
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:26,012
Please tell me.

478
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:32,317
Don't do it.
Don't marry him.

479
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:35,087
Then I won't.

480
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:39,160
Did you hear that,
Mr. Kayama?

481
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,330
That's my answer.

482
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:43,659
This is absurd!

483
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:48,497
What about the promise
you made just days ago?

484
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:55,211
Mr. Tohata,
what on earth is going on?

485
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:02,374
Oh, I see!
You're pleased about all this.

486
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:04,053
What?

487
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:08,486
It's obvious you're loath
to part with your treasure.

488
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:14,030
I look like a fool.

489
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:15,924
You?

490
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:18,101
I'm the one
who looks like a fool!

491
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:28,935
This is all your doing.

492
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:31,046
Friends shouldn't quarrel.

493
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:35,843
Mr. Ono, Mr. Kayama...

494
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,822
don't try to blame Mr. Tohata.

495
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:46,858
I have no intention

496
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:48,691
of going back to him.

497
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:52,134
Why that face?

498
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:59,002
You needn't pay anything
to be free of me.

499
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:05,070
You can put away
your 600,000 yen.

500
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:10,980
This house, and everything in it -
you can have it all back!

501
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:13,312
Taeko!

502
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:22,894
I'm leaving here tonight...
with nothing.

503
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,624
No, Taeko!

504
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:28,961
I was wrong.
I've been such a fool.

505
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:33,866
I've had enough.

506
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,239
I'm no longer...

507
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:42,479
your 14-year-old mistress.

508
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,085
Listen to me.

509
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:48,616
I swear to you.

510
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:53,359
I don't care anymore
what the world thinks.

511
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:56,326
I'll marry you.

512
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,547
Don't flatter yourself!

513
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:17,177
To think I'd ever marry you!

514
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:31,227
Who are you?

515
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:33,062
What is this?

516
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:37,399
One million yen.

517
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:41,200
So you kept your promise?

518
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:43,839
Thank you.

519
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:48,578
This man raised
a million yen to pay for me.

520
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:52,920
That's 400,000 more than you.
- Fool!

521
00:49:53,123 --> 00:49:55,785
No, I'm tired of putting on airs!

522
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,790
As of tomorrow I'm penniless.

523
00:50:00,263 --> 00:50:04,632
Who would take in
a penniless woman,

524
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,030
and another man's
castoff no less?

525
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,400
Right, Mr. Kayama?

526
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:16,810
Why ask me?
Isn't Mr. Kameda your confidant?

527
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:21,944
I...

528
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,381
I would take you in.

529
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:35,564
What did you just say?

530
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:42,462
I said I would take you in.

531
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:49,274
A woman like me?
The way I am?

532
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,078
Yes.

533
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:57,748
But what do you mean,
"A woman like me?"

534
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:01,789
I don't understand.

535
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:15,264
Why do you all laugh?

536
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:19,373
I guess I didn't phrase it well.

537
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:24,673
All I meant to say...

538
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:29,509
is that Miss Nasu
is very pure.

539
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:34,547
Stop it, you idiot!

540
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:38,459
How dare you mock me?

541
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:52,705
I really am sick.

542
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,705
My brain's gone bad.

543
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:03,910
I guess that's why
it didn't come out right.

544
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:09,882
But I said
what I honestly feel.

545
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:17,556
I don't care how much
people laugh at me.

546
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:20,531
I believe
you're a pure woman.

547
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:29,110
You just said you'd leave here
and give everything up.

548
00:52:30,046 --> 00:52:33,812
That says it all.
That's enough for me.

549
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:40,547
And I'll let no one
speak ill of you.

550
00:52:46,596 --> 00:52:50,123
So why feel ashamed?

551
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:56,167
Why sell yourself to him
for a million yen?

552
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:03,773
Butt out!

553
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:05,675
I won't remain silent.

554
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:12,120
You've suffered alone
for so long...

555
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:18,818
that it feels wrong
if you're not in pain.

556
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:22,393
You are ill.

557
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,991
You need a kind nurse.

558
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:31,238
I'll nurse you back to health.

559
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:36,902
She's accustomed to luxury.
How will you support her?

560
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,380
You're penniless yourself.

561
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:48,587
I'll find work somehow.

562
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:52,650
Listen to him!
What, shoveling snow?

563
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:56,696
For that you'd make
about 300 yen.

564
00:53:57,667 --> 00:54:01,626
Not even enough
to buy her cosmetics.

565
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:04,235
That's enough!

566
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:07,935
Stop ridiculing him.

567
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:12,448
Thank you.

568
00:54:13,283 --> 00:54:18,880
No one's ever said
anything like that to me before.

569
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:30,056
Miss Taeko...

570
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:34,568
I...

571
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:39,503
Somehow, I'll -

572
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:50,610
When I first saw your picture...

573
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:55,391
you seemed
to be calling to me.

574
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:02,999
You see...

575
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:07,731
I've been waiting
for somebody like you.

576
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:16,535
Ever since I began
this awful life as a kept woman,

577
00:55:16,746 --> 00:55:18,714
I've been waiting.

578
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,974
I hoped and prayed...

579
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:25,746
imagining someone like you.

580
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:30,988
Hoping...

581
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:36,655
that a good, honest,
kind man would appear.

582
00:55:39,035 --> 00:55:42,835
"Taeko, it's not your fault.

583
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:49,171
I still respect you. "

584
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:57,613
How I longed
to hear those words!

585
00:56:08,131 --> 00:56:12,124
But instead it was
always just him.

586
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:17,868
He'd do lewd and shameful
things to me and then leave.

587
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:45,290
I can't take it anymore.

588
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:50,264
I'd rather die in the street...

589
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:56,174
than go on living like this.

590
00:56:57,781 --> 00:56:59,112
Yet...

591
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,652
I'm afraid...

592
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:08,490
the life you envision for us...

593
00:57:10,827 --> 00:57:13,261
is a fairy tale.

594
00:57:15,565 --> 00:57:19,126
Everyone,
I have an announcement.

595
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:30,769
Actually,
it's more of a confession.

596
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,396
In truth...

597
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:50,426
I'm an utterly despicable man.

598
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:56,571
Until this moment,
I've hidden the fact

599
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:02,405
that Mr. Kameda possesses
a considerable fortune.

600
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:12,718
As his relative,
I thought it was in his best interest.

601
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,583
Anyway...

602
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:21,024
I wish to announce that Mr. Kameda
is the owner of a 125-acre farm.

603
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,126
Get back!

604
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:33,005
You really feel
that way about her?

605
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,794
Don't be ridiculous.

606
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,861
What?
So you mean you'll -

607
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:59,231
Isn't it obvious?
I'm going with you.

608
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:02,427
Taeko!
A man like him?

609
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:03,936
Get lost!

610
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:09,571
I can't...

611
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:22,113
I can't ruin the life
of an innocent child like you.

612
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:24,755
Out of the way!

613
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:30,296
Hey, don't forget this -
the million yen.

614
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,094
I worked hard
to scrape it together.

615
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:53,879
Everyone stay back!

616
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,183
I give it to Mr. Kayama.

617
00:59:56,392 --> 01:00:01,625
Pull it out with your bare hands
and it's yours!

618
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:04,527
It's burning!

619
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:07,528
It's burning!

620
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:12,673
A million yen!
I wrapped it with my own hands!

621
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:14,968
Be quiet!
Let me go!

622
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:19,343
Mr. Kayama,
don't just stand there.

623
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:21,483
Hurry or it'll all burn.

624
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:31,987
What's the matter?
Don't you want it now?

625
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:34,763
Please have mercy!

626
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:38,525
It's all burning!

627
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:43,732
You little worm!

628
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:47,071
Take a good look.

629
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:49,678
That's how we do things!

630
01:00:55,218 --> 01:00:59,018
Mr. Kayama, drop the act...

631
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:02,357
or you'll regret it later.

632
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:24,005
Pull it out, man!

633
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:27,478
What's a little pride?

634
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:53,903
Hurry!

635
01:01:55,244 --> 01:01:58,407
It's all burning!
Hurry!

636
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:03,274
It'll burn up! Hurry!

637
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:17,433
It's safe.

638
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:21,565
It's safe.

639
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:25,897
A few thousand yen
got burned, that's all.

640
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:49,687
Move!

641
01:02:57,707 --> 01:02:59,174
Listen, everybody.

642
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:04,477
This is all for Mr. Kayama.

643
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:10,048
He didn't pull it out.
He would have let it burn.

644
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,647
It's his by right.

645
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:15,151
Is that clear?

646
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:20,153
And now,
farewell to you all.

647
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:22,490
Out of the way!

648
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:38,146
Farewell, Mr. Kameda.

649
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,411
Come on, men!
Time to drink!

650
01:04:02,038 --> 01:04:04,563
Kameda, don't go after her!

651
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:07,743
She's a fallen woman!
You can't save her!

652
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:15,544
Kameda!

653
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:24,216
FEBRUARY

654
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:31,099
Ayako,
don't play with your food.

655
01:04:33,236 --> 01:04:35,761
And why are you all so quiet?

656
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:39,774
You've all been acting
so strange lately.

657
01:04:40,142 --> 01:04:41,700
It's the weather.

658
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:45,472
Weeks without sun.
Everybody gets depressed.

659
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:50,050
It's not the weather, that much I know.
It's that man.

660
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:54,181
I really misjudged him.

661
01:04:56,459 --> 01:05:02,329
Why give him the ranch if he's going
to spend his money on that hussy?

662
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:03,725
But -

663
01:05:03,933 --> 01:05:07,869
And what bothers me
the most is how you did it.

664
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:10,800
Wasn't there
a more straightforward way?

665
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:13,601
Why bring that Karube in
as an agent?

666
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:19,770
And you, acting so secretively,
as if you were the guilty one!

667
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:25,645
And Kameda could have at least
stopped by to thank you.

668
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:29,324
Perhaps he's an idiot after all.

669
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:33,955
What's so funny?

670
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:35,656
It's just -

671
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:39,858
That again?
That's all you seem to say.

672
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:42,401
It's just that Ayako -

673
01:05:55,384 --> 01:06:00,014
She's up to something again.
Some fine young ladies you are.

674
01:06:00,523 --> 01:06:03,048
Out with it.
What's going on?

675
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:05,591
Mr. Kameda sent her
a strange letter.

676
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:07,854
A letter? When?

677
01:06:08,064 --> 01:06:11,522
Kayama's brother gave it to her
last week at the skating rink.

678
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:16,728
Little Kaoru? Not surprising,
given his older brother.

679
01:06:16,939 --> 01:06:20,636
But Kameda's in Tokyo.
How is that possible?

680
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:23,710
It was enclosed
in a package to Kayama.

681
01:06:24,513 --> 01:06:26,606
What was in the letter?

682
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:54,903
"I have no idea
why I'm writing to you like this.

683
01:06:56,946 --> 01:07:03,010
But I simply cannot
suppress the hope

684
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:07,781
that perhaps
you remember me fondly.

685
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:12,359
For reasons I don't understand,
you're very important to me,

686
01:07:12,561 --> 01:07:15,155
extremely important.

687
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:19,562
I have nothing else to write
about myself, nor any desire to do so.

688
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:22,738
I wish you every happiness. "

689
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:51,463
What's so funny?

690
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:55,626
You're laughing at the letter -
do you know why?

691
01:07:56,839 --> 01:08:02,471
Because there's not a single lie in it.
It's so honest that it's funny.

692
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:07,545
Not laughing now, are you?

693
01:08:14,957 --> 01:08:18,222
Well, well.
You lost that one, didn't you?

694
01:08:18,694 --> 01:08:21,254
But why did he send it?

695
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:25,195
Have you heard
any more gossip about our idiot?

696
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:31,033
It seems he and that roughneck Akama
are both still chasing Taeko.

697
01:08:42,151 --> 01:08:44,449
Taeko, being who she is,

698
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:49,751
swings like a pendulum
from one to the other.

699
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:53,918
She agreed to marry Akama

700
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,860
but then ran away
with Kameda.

701
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:59,694
Things are bound to end badly.

702
01:09:09,745 --> 01:09:12,111
Did you forget something?

703
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:16,011
No, but I felt
I was being watched.

704
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:21,584
You mean
murder or something?

705
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:24,088
Akama's not above it.

706
01:09:26,028 --> 01:09:28,997
Stop that.
It's too morbid to think about.

707
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:22,850
Come in.

708
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,364
Don't bother
taking off your shoes.

709
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:53,465
Watch your step here.

710
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:50,355
What's wrong with you?
Stop staring at me like that.

711
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:53,734
Sit down.

712
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:59,570
Akama, I want you
to tell me the truth.

713
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:02,775
Was that you at the station?

714
01:13:02,978 --> 01:13:05,538
I don't know
what you're talking about.

715
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:11,448
I glimpsed a pair of eyes
in the crowd exactly like yours.

716
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:14,588
I wonder who it was.

717
01:13:15,758 --> 01:13:18,226
Maybe I was just
imagining things.

718
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:21,658
That happens to me a lot.

719
01:13:28,637 --> 01:13:30,969
What a dark room!

720
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:34,042
It's an old house.

721
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:41,475
I could tell from a block away
that this was your house.

722
01:13:43,819 --> 01:13:45,286
How?

723
01:13:48,557 --> 01:13:54,257
I just knew
your house would be like this.

724
01:13:56,031 --> 01:13:58,158
It really is dark.

725
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:05,570
There's something
dark and gloomy about you too.

726
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:37,262
Will you two live here
after you marry?

727
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:39,805
Of course.
This is my home.

728
01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:42,604
Is the wedding soon?

729
01:14:42,811 --> 01:14:48,545
You know I can't decide
a thing like that on my own.

730
01:14:49,351 --> 01:14:53,287
Akama, please don't hide
anything from me.

731
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:57,858
I have no intention
of standing in your way.

732
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:03,321
She's back in Sapporo too,
isn't she?

733
01:15:06,034 --> 01:15:08,264
You've come to an agreement,
haven't you?

734
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:10,267
What if we have?

735
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:16,874
Is that what you came
to find out?

736
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:18,740
No.

737
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:23,314
But I honestly feel it's best

738
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:26,783
for you two not to marry.

739
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:31,382
I've said so many times.

740
01:15:31,894 --> 01:15:37,833
It would mean ruin
for her and for you.

741
01:15:39,735 --> 01:15:44,866
But there's nothing
I can do to stop you.

742
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:53,409
You understand, don't you?

743
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:59,076
I simply feel sorry for her.

744
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:04,320
Everything she does
worries me.

745
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,893
I can't just sit by and watch.

746
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:12,666
We discussed this in Tokyo,
didn't we?

747
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:25,407
I simply want her
to be happy, that's all.

748
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:32,715
Why are you
glaring at me like that?

749
01:16:34,289 --> 01:16:36,484
I'll be going now.

750
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:39,483
Good-bye.

751
01:16:40,896 --> 01:16:43,990
Stay.
It's been a while.

752
01:16:47,502 --> 01:16:53,372
The minute you leave,
I know I'll start hating you again.

753
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:59,838
You made me boil for a month
after we parted in Tokyo.

754
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:02,641
I wanted to poison you.

755
01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:06,452
It's true.

756
01:17:07,689 --> 01:17:13,628
But ten minutes in your presence
and my anger evaporates...

757
01:17:16,164 --> 01:17:19,759
and amazingly,
I like you as much as ever.

758
01:17:26,742 --> 01:17:29,006
You're a strange one.

759
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:33,236
We're opposites
in so many ways.

760
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,347
Have a drink.

761
01:17:42,024 --> 01:17:43,651
Now listen.

762
01:17:44,459 --> 01:17:48,156
You love her
because you feel sorry for her.

763
01:17:49,231 --> 01:17:52,860
But I hate her
as much as I love her!

764
01:17:53,568 --> 01:17:57,527
Sometimes I think
it'd be easier if she were dead.

765
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:02,468
She hates me too,
with all her might!

766
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:10,384
Once I beat her black and blue
for the way she looks down on me.

767
01:18:10,585 --> 01:18:12,280
You didn't!

768
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:13,977
Yes, I did!

769
01:18:16,124 --> 01:18:22,029
I sat outside her door for two days
without eating or drinking to apologize.

770
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:27,324
I terrified the maid at the inn.
She stopped coming to the room.

771
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:30,638
Taeko finally got fed up
and came out.

772
01:18:30,839 --> 01:18:32,807
Know what she said?

773
01:18:33,008 --> 01:18:36,739
"What would you do
if I never forgave you?"

774
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:41,812
I told her over and over
that I would die.

775
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:49,112
Then she said,
"You'll probably kill me first. "

776
01:18:55,597 --> 01:19:00,660
When I saw her here in Sapporo
about a week ago, she said,

777
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:04,171
"I've made up my mind.

778
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:11,778
I'm an outcast anyway,
so I'll do as you say.

779
01:19:13,014 --> 01:19:16,643
But I want to be free
just a little longer...

780
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:24,181
until I've had
my fill of freedom. "

781
01:19:25,293 --> 01:19:26,760
What do you think?

782
01:19:27,896 --> 01:19:30,922
I don't understand it.

783
01:19:33,969 --> 01:19:35,834
Are you sure?

784
01:19:38,306 --> 01:19:40,501
Want me to spell it out?

785
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:43,802
She's in love
with another man,

786
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:47,107
and that man is you!

787
01:19:49,551 --> 01:19:52,247
It's the hand of fate!

788
01:19:53,355 --> 01:19:55,585
She can never marry you.

789
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:59,719
Why? Because she doesn't
want to ruin you!

790
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:04,061
So she'll ruin me and drag me
down to hell with her!

791
01:20:05,066 --> 01:20:06,966
What a thing to say!

792
01:20:07,169 --> 01:20:11,970
You're just imagining things.

793
01:20:12,774 --> 01:20:15,038
It's simply jealousy.

794
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,002
Stop that!

795
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:22,079
I shouldn't have come

796
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:26,084
if my being here makes you
think these thoughts.

797
01:20:26,955 --> 01:20:28,980
Something told me
not to come,

798
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:34,060
but I wanted us
to part on good terms.

799
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:38,221
I wanted our memories of Sapporo
to be pleasant ones.

800
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:52,642
You use that
for cutting paper?

801
01:20:53,181 --> 01:20:54,239
Yes.

802
01:20:55,951 --> 01:21:00,115
But it's not
a paper knife, is it?

803
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:03,881
It's a butcher's knife.

804
01:21:04,559 --> 01:21:07,084
But there's no law
against cutting paper with it.

805
01:21:07,295 --> 01:21:08,922
I suppose not.

806
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:11,665
But...

807
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:15,226
it looks brand-new.

808
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:19,106
You saying I can't
afford a new knife?

809
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:28,047
What got into me?

810
01:21:29,317 --> 01:21:34,880
When my head
starts to get heavy,

811
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:40,118
I say and do things
without even realizing it.

812
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:45,658
It's been getting worse lately.

813
01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:50,999
Maybe it's a sign
of an approaching fit.

814
01:22:00,181 --> 01:22:04,379
Well, please excuse me.
Be well.

815
01:22:07,555 --> 01:22:10,524
It's not safe.
I'll go with you.

816
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:27,003
What's that?

817
01:22:28,476 --> 01:22:32,970
My mother. She prays
to the Buddha every day.

818
01:22:42,424 --> 01:22:45,689
And you?
Do you ever pray?

819
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:52,524
I mean,
do you believe in a god?

820
01:22:52,734 --> 01:22:56,932
Not really.

821
01:22:57,472 --> 01:23:00,270
I was made
to pray as a child.

822
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:05,545
That's how my mother is.
I always had to carry an amulet.

823
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:08,980
I still do, in my wallet.

824
01:23:09,684 --> 01:23:14,348
I carry a sort of charm too.
It's just a plain stone.

825
01:23:14,556 --> 01:23:15,750
A stone?

826
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:22,888
It's nothing special,
but it has great meaning for me.

827
01:23:23,565 --> 01:23:27,433
I told you, right?
About my death sentence?

828
01:23:27,969 --> 01:23:32,599
How the shock of being
pardoned drove me insane?

829
01:23:32,907 --> 01:23:36,900
Just then I went into a trance
and picked up this stone.

830
01:23:37,112 --> 01:23:39,580
It's still precious to me.

831
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:43,377
You have it now?

832
01:23:46,054 --> 01:23:47,646
Show it to me.

833
01:24:02,137 --> 01:24:03,434
Can I keep it?

834
01:24:05,106 --> 01:24:06,334
What for?

835
01:24:08,743 --> 01:24:10,267
I don't know.

836
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:13,404
I'd just like to have it.

837
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:16,441
I'll trade you my amulet for it.

838
01:24:18,653 --> 01:24:20,644
You want to swap charms?

839
01:24:20,855 --> 01:24:25,519
I remember doing that
with friends as a boy.

840
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:46,970
Let's have tea with Mother.

841
01:24:52,387 --> 01:24:58,519
Mother, this is Mr. Kameda,
a very close friend.

842
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:00,691
Make us some tea.

843
01:25:05,700 --> 01:25:07,861
Tea!

844
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:17,073
Relax.

845
01:25:18,113 --> 01:25:25,019
She's oblivious to everything -
even what a useless bum I am.

846
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:26,346
Right, Mother?

847
01:25:37,966 --> 01:25:42,869
She seems to like you.
She'll share the cake offering with you.

848
01:26:50,572 --> 01:26:52,767
Eat it.
It'll make her happy.

849
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:20,099
Well...

850
01:27:26,207 --> 01:27:28,266
We don't need to shake hands.

851
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:30,901
We've already exchanged charms.

852
01:27:35,617 --> 01:27:38,711
All right, take her!
It's the only way!

853
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,354
I'm giving her to you!
Don't forget me!

854
01:31:05,693 --> 01:31:10,653
<i>What was it I saw
that shone so?</i>

855
01:33:21,629 --> 01:33:24,860
END OF PART 1

856
01:33:26,867 --> 01:33:30,826
PART 2
LOVE AND LOATHING

857
01:33:57,832 --> 01:33:59,800
The juvenile delinquent!

858
01:34:03,104 --> 01:34:06,096
So you don't like
being called that?

859
01:34:06,307 --> 01:34:10,744
How about postman?
Messenger boy? Errand boy?

860
01:34:11,212 --> 01:34:13,680
Cat got your tongue?

861
01:34:13,881 --> 01:34:18,409
It shows you know it's wrong
to deliver strange letters to young ladies.

862
01:34:18,619 --> 01:34:20,917
But you were quite tactful
with today's delivery.

863
01:34:21,122 --> 01:34:23,386
Anyway, stop gaping
and tell me:

864
01:34:23,591 --> 01:34:26,287
Where's Mr. Kameda hospitalized?
Or is he asleep inside?

865
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:28,519
He's come to already.

866
01:34:28,729 --> 01:34:31,323
People can recover that easily?

867
01:34:31,532 --> 01:34:33,591
Disappointed?

868
01:34:33,801 --> 01:34:36,929
Nice try, but you won't
get even that way.

869
01:34:37,138 --> 01:34:41,199
But I was a fool,
rushing to get here.

870
01:34:41,409 --> 01:34:42,842
Then go home.

871
01:34:43,044 --> 01:34:46,275
That's enough.
I'll do as I please.

872
01:34:51,552 --> 01:34:55,181
Mr. Kameda, you're really
quite an ingrate.

873
01:34:55,389 --> 01:34:57,755
Not so loud.
He's not well.

874
01:34:57,958 --> 01:35:01,724
I know that.
That's why I'm letting him off easy.

875
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:05,929
Didn't you go too far
about the ranch?

876
01:35:06,133 --> 01:35:09,227
Sending this man
to our house

877
01:35:09,437 --> 01:35:11,598
like some kind
of debt collector!

878
01:35:11,806 --> 01:35:14,570
What did you do,
Mr. Karube?

879
01:35:16,410 --> 01:35:18,344
Well, you see,

880
01:35:19,213 --> 01:35:22,842
you have a right
to what's yours.

881
01:35:23,050 --> 01:35:24,984
A right?

882
01:35:25,619 --> 01:35:27,849
Just what did you do?

883
01:35:28,055 --> 01:35:31,650
Well, I never!
You really don't know?

884
01:35:32,393 --> 01:35:37,888
May I ask who's paying
all your expenses?

885
01:35:38,599 --> 01:35:42,091
This may sound
quite forward of me,

886
01:35:42,303 --> 01:35:47,673
but Mr. Ono said I owned
the rights to a large ranch.

887
01:35:47,908 --> 01:35:53,141
Mr. Karube said he'd lend me money
with the ranch as collateral.

888
01:35:53,347 --> 01:35:54,814
This is outrageous!

889
01:35:55,015 --> 01:35:59,452
He said he was your agent
and forced my husband to pay.

890
01:36:00,020 --> 01:36:02,887
Just like my husband,
to be fooled by such a man!

891
01:36:03,090 --> 01:36:07,049
You can't run away!
I'll be filing a formal complaint!

892
01:36:07,461 --> 01:36:10,089
Please, don't be rash.

893
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:16,529
I intended all along
to settle accounts fairly.

894
01:36:16,737 --> 01:36:22,403
Bilk this poor innocent of one penny
and you'll settle them from a jail cell.

895
01:36:29,717 --> 01:36:31,617
Step outside, please.

896
01:36:31,819 --> 01:36:35,220
I have something
to discuss with Mr. Kameda.

897
01:36:49,637 --> 01:36:52,071
You really are something.

898
01:36:59,013 --> 01:37:01,311
No, I can't say any more.

899
01:37:01,515 --> 01:37:04,780
One look at you
and the words melt away.

900
01:37:04,985 --> 01:37:08,318
I'm not mocking you.
In fact, it's your -

901
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:09,748
forgive me -

902
01:37:09,957 --> 01:37:15,190
it's your dimwittedness
that's almost mocking. I mean -

903
01:37:15,396 --> 01:37:17,921
Just what do I mean?

904
01:37:18,132 --> 01:37:21,966
What got me going like this?
Ah, that's right.

905
01:37:22,169 --> 01:37:25,696
It's time I asked after you.
How are you feeling?

906
01:37:25,906 --> 01:37:27,703
Much better.

907
01:37:27,908 --> 01:37:32,174
Still, please be careful.
You're quite pale.

908
01:37:34,181 --> 01:37:38,208
Are you still on your own?
Married yet?

909
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:41,146
No.

910
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:43,380
What are you grinning about?

911
01:37:43,591 --> 01:37:47,083
Of course
I was being sarcastic.

912
01:37:49,330 --> 01:37:53,130
Anyway, I'm here for a reason.
I must ask you something.

913
01:37:53,334 --> 01:37:54,699
What is it?

914
01:37:54,902 --> 01:37:58,167
I read your letter to Ayako.

915
01:37:58,539 --> 01:38:00,564
What was the meaning of that?

916
01:38:04,211 --> 01:38:08,079
It was such a fine day
when I wrote it.

917
01:38:09,950 --> 01:38:11,918
I didn't ask
about the weather!

918
01:38:12,519 --> 01:38:17,980
I know, but on such
a bright, sunny day,

919
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:20,720
a man burns with hope.

920
01:38:21,095 --> 01:38:24,428
What kind of hope?
For Ayako?

921
01:38:24,632 --> 01:38:26,862
Are you in love with her?

922
01:38:27,434 --> 01:38:28,423
No.

923
01:38:28,636 --> 01:38:30,604
Are you sure?

924
01:38:35,075 --> 01:38:36,201
I think so.

925
01:38:36,410 --> 01:38:38,435
See?
You're not sure at all.

926
01:38:38,646 --> 01:38:41,342
But I wonder
how she feels about you.

927
01:38:41,548 --> 01:38:44,574
She has more disdain
for you than praise.

928
01:38:44,785 --> 01:38:48,516
She calls you
an invalid and an idiot.

929
01:38:48,923 --> 01:38:50,515
But don't be offended.

930
01:38:50,724 --> 01:38:55,991
She really takes after me -
willful with a touch of craziness.

931
01:38:56,196 --> 01:39:01,566
If she likes someone,
she'll call him names and tease him.

932
01:39:01,769 --> 01:39:06,206
But don't get
your hopes up just yet.

933
01:39:07,241 --> 01:39:11,940
It's a constant worry
having grown-up daughters.

934
01:39:12,146 --> 01:39:14,273
Did you hear
about Mr. Kayama?

935
01:39:14,481 --> 01:39:16,574
No.
What about him?

936
01:39:16,784 --> 01:39:20,481
He has "hopes"
regarding Ayako as well.

937
01:39:20,955 --> 01:39:25,949
He regained her trust
after that incident with the money.

938
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:31,393
Giving it back to Taeko
was a real masterstroke.

939
01:39:31,598 --> 01:39:33,998
But be that as it may -

940
01:39:34,201 --> 01:39:38,729
Oh, yes, I'd better give him
a talking-to as well.

941
01:39:40,474 --> 01:39:42,465
Take good care of yourself.

942
01:39:43,644 --> 01:39:47,705
By the way, I'd rather
you didn't come visit for a while.

943
01:39:47,915 --> 01:39:52,181
Especially not on a nice day.
You get my drift?

944
01:39:54,054 --> 01:39:55,316
Yes.

945
01:39:55,522 --> 01:40:00,824
Ayako already
forbade me to visit.

946
01:40:01,028 --> 01:40:02,620
What? When?

947
01:40:03,364 --> 01:40:06,822
She wrote back to me
while I was in Tokyo.

948
01:40:07,201 --> 01:40:09,192
That postman again!

949
01:40:09,403 --> 01:40:10,870
Postman?

950
01:40:11,071 --> 01:40:14,700
Never mind.
What did she write?

951
01:40:21,281 --> 01:40:23,613
"There's no hope at all.

952
01:40:24,284 --> 01:40:26,844
I have no wish
to ever see you again. "

953
01:40:27,054 --> 01:40:29,318
That was the gist of it.

954
01:40:32,292 --> 01:40:38,060
Knowing her, it could mean there's hope
and that she wants to see you.

955
01:40:39,299 --> 01:40:43,258
I'll feel her out
and get to the bottom of this!

956
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:54,208
Leaving already, Mrs. Ono?

957
01:40:54,415 --> 01:40:56,406
Is your family well?

958
01:40:56,617 --> 01:40:58,676
Won't you stay for tea?

959
01:41:05,225 --> 01:41:06,852
It's so cold.

960
01:41:11,632 --> 01:41:16,035
What did Mrs. Ono
say to you in the hallway?

961
01:41:18,705 --> 01:41:22,641
I think I can guess.
You went completely red in the face.

962
01:41:22,843 --> 01:41:24,435
Then don't ask.

963
01:41:24,645 --> 01:41:29,344
Why are you acting like this?
Still holding a grudge?

964
01:41:29,550 --> 01:41:33,782
I'm on your side,
especially in this matter.

965
01:41:34,054 --> 01:41:35,521
What matter?

966
01:41:35,722 --> 01:41:40,091
Still playing dumb?
She warned you about Ayako, right?

967
01:41:40,694 --> 01:41:45,996
It makes me so mad.
Does she think we're beneath her?

968
01:41:46,366 --> 01:41:48,527
I'm merely their employee.

969
01:41:48,735 --> 01:41:50,566
You don't really mean that.

970
01:41:51,572 --> 01:41:55,474
So don't be like this.
Pull yourself together.

971
01:41:56,977 --> 01:41:59,445
Ayako's just shy.

972
01:41:59,646 --> 01:42:03,480
That's why she acts so crazy.

973
01:42:03,684 --> 01:42:06,175
It's just a smoke screen.

974
01:42:12,226 --> 01:42:14,854
- Is that from Kameda's room?
- Yes.

975
01:42:15,295 --> 01:42:19,391
Kaoru's putting on his costume
for the ice carnival.

976
01:42:23,570 --> 01:42:25,731
Kameda seems
in a good mood.

977
01:42:27,541 --> 01:42:29,600
Be careful.

978
01:42:30,110 --> 01:42:33,807
Mrs. Ono gave him
a talking-to as well.

979
01:42:34,081 --> 01:42:38,780
And then she rushed out.
Something's definitely going on.

980
01:43:24,298 --> 01:43:27,324
- They're all crazy.
- Mother!

981
01:43:31,338 --> 01:43:33,898
Who are you looking for?

982
01:43:34,107 --> 01:43:38,942
Don't worry. The invalid
won't dare come out in this cold.

983
01:43:50,757 --> 01:43:53,726
- Who's that fool?
- He's a clown.

984
01:43:58,098 --> 01:44:00,396
It's me, the postman!

985
01:44:22,556 --> 01:44:24,251
I hope he falls!

986
01:44:25,525 --> 01:44:26,753
Be careful!

987
01:44:31,598 --> 01:44:35,090
Laugh all you want.
You'll pay later.

988
01:44:35,869 --> 01:44:39,930
You too, Ayako.
You ridicule me no end.

989
01:44:40,140 --> 01:44:42,768
What were you two
whispering about?

990
01:44:42,976 --> 01:44:46,969
Spit it out!
What did the postman tell you?

991
01:44:47,748 --> 01:44:48,976
Good evening.

992
01:44:49,182 --> 01:44:51,946
I looked all over.
I thought you'd be here.

993
01:44:52,152 --> 01:44:53,642
Good evening.

994
01:44:53,854 --> 01:44:57,119
Kaoru just told me
you were here.

995
01:44:57,958 --> 01:45:00,085
Let's go over there.

996
01:45:00,594 --> 01:45:03,563
My feet are frozen
from standing still.

997
01:45:05,966 --> 01:45:07,593
You little liar!

998
01:45:22,649 --> 01:45:26,585
It's hideous!
What were they thinking?

999
01:45:27,354 --> 01:45:31,154
I'm going.
Enough of this nonsense!

1000
01:45:34,094 --> 01:45:35,686
I knew it!

1001
01:45:41,101 --> 01:45:46,038
Why do you stare like that?
Can't you greet a person?

1002
01:45:47,741 --> 01:45:49,709
Let's go over there.

1003
01:45:49,910 --> 01:45:54,347
Mother, go on without me.
Mr. Kayama will see me home.

1004
01:45:59,853 --> 01:46:01,946
What are you doing here?

1005
01:46:02,155 --> 01:46:05,716
Don't be too smug.
You have no right.

1006
01:46:05,926 --> 01:46:10,454
Have you forgotten what you
were willing to do for 600,000 yen?

1007
01:46:19,106 --> 01:46:21,540
Was that her?

1008
01:46:21,742 --> 01:46:25,041
I want to ask you something.
Be here tomorrow at noon.

1009
01:46:25,245 --> 01:46:28,305
Come along.
How dare she insult us!

1010
01:46:28,648 --> 01:46:30,775
Noriko, come on!

1011
01:46:38,959 --> 01:46:41,120
Tough luck, huh?

1012
01:46:41,328 --> 01:46:43,762
You have no business
being here.

1013
01:46:51,638 --> 01:46:56,940
Aren't you angry at me
after what I did?

1014
01:46:57,144 --> 01:47:00,944
We traded charms.
Of course I trust you.

1015
01:47:03,049 --> 01:47:05,017
Well, I'm no good.

1016
01:47:06,753 --> 01:47:11,122
Do you know Taeko
wants you to marry Ayako?

1017
01:47:12,859 --> 01:47:15,350
But a lot of good
that does me!

1018
01:47:15,562 --> 01:47:18,497
She wants you to be happy.

1019
01:47:18,698 --> 01:47:21,189
That means
she loves you after all!

1020
01:48:01,608 --> 01:48:04,133
What? You fell asleep?

1021
01:48:06,613 --> 01:48:08,604
You actually fell asleep?

1022
01:48:10,016 --> 01:48:12,678
Oh, it's you.

1023
01:48:12,886 --> 01:48:14,854
I must have dozed off.

1024
01:48:16,823 --> 01:48:20,782
Didn't someone else
try to wake me?

1025
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:30,659
I thought
another woman was here.

1026
01:48:30,871 --> 01:48:34,466
I must have dreamt it.
Yes, it was a dream.

1027
01:48:36,977 --> 01:48:40,845
I see.
You mean her, don't you?

1028
01:48:41,414 --> 01:48:45,373
What did you dream
about her?

1029
01:48:46,887 --> 01:48:49,117
No, I don't want to know!

1030
01:48:51,658 --> 01:48:55,594
But why did you fall asleep?
Really!

1031
01:48:58,398 --> 01:48:59,865
Look at that!

1032
01:49:03,370 --> 01:49:05,634
Doesn't it look silly?

1033
01:49:06,806 --> 01:49:09,297
It seemed
so impressive last night.

1034
01:49:10,544 --> 01:49:13,707
Why on earth
did I come here?

1035
01:49:14,948 --> 01:49:18,213
You made me promise
to meet you here.

1036
01:49:19,286 --> 01:49:23,154
I have no use for men
who fall asleep like that.

1037
01:49:23,356 --> 01:49:26,086
I didn't get
any sleep last night.

1038
01:49:26,293 --> 01:49:29,126
Mr. Kayama attempted suicide.

1039
01:49:31,031 --> 01:49:34,728
- Wasn't he just pretending?
- You may be right.

1040
01:49:42,075 --> 01:49:45,101
In that case,
I'll go easy on you.

1041
01:49:46,479 --> 01:49:48,811
I'll get to the point.

1042
01:49:51,451 --> 01:49:57,048
Do you know why
I asked to meet you here?

1043
01:50:09,302 --> 01:50:13,671
Because I can't stand it
when people make fun of you.

1044
01:50:15,208 --> 01:50:17,699
You're a bit -

1045
01:50:18,478 --> 01:50:20,571
I'll be frank.

1046
01:50:22,015 --> 01:50:26,748
At times your illness
makes you seem comical.

1047
01:50:26,953 --> 01:50:30,946
But in wisdom,
the most important thing,

1048
01:50:31,157 --> 01:50:34,649
you're far ahead
of everyone else.

1049
01:50:36,396 --> 01:50:42,130
Wisdom comes in two kinds:
Important and unimportant.

1050
01:50:49,576 --> 01:50:52,545
But nobody realizes that.

1051
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:56,242
No, actually Mother does.

1052
01:50:56,983 --> 01:50:59,952
And I do too,
but we're different.

1053
01:51:02,055 --> 01:51:07,925
I've waited a long time
for a chance to tell you this.

1054
01:51:08,762 --> 01:51:12,459
Remember that letter
you sent me?

1055
01:51:13,133 --> 01:51:17,900
Ever since then -
no, even before that -

1056
01:51:21,307 --> 01:51:24,105
But why did you chase
after that woman?

1057
01:51:24,310 --> 01:51:27,711
I'll bet you even
came back for her!

1058
01:51:29,149 --> 01:51:31,379
I detest you!

1059
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:36,653
I love Mr. Kayama.

1060
01:51:42,862 --> 01:51:45,524
- That's a lie.
- No, it's true!

1061
01:51:45,732 --> 01:51:49,964
Ask this bench.
We often meet here.

1062
01:51:55,108 --> 01:51:56,575
Another lie.

1063
01:51:56,776 --> 01:52:01,907
So what if it is?
Anyway, he's completely changed.

1064
01:52:02,115 --> 01:52:07,052
To prove it, he cut off his finger
right before my eyes.

1065
01:52:07,287 --> 01:52:08,914
Which hand?

1066
01:52:10,023 --> 01:52:13,515
What's the difference?
He cut it off!

1067
01:52:13,727 --> 01:52:17,686
I saw his hands last night.
They looked just fine.

1068
01:52:29,342 --> 01:52:31,606
Tell me the truth.

1069
01:52:32,979 --> 01:52:35,948
You're crazy about Taeko,
aren't you?

1070
01:52:36,282 --> 01:52:40,218
Yes, but not
in the way you think.

1071
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:42,445
How would you know
what I think?

1072
01:52:42,655 --> 01:52:44,247
Let me rephrase that.

1073
01:52:44,457 --> 01:52:47,722
My feelings for her
are a mystery to me,

1074
01:52:47,927 --> 01:52:50,760
so I assumed
you wouldn't understand either.

1075
01:52:52,065 --> 01:52:54,192
What would you do

1076
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:58,461
if your closest friend,
as close as a sibling,

1077
01:52:58,671 --> 01:53:04,303
were thrown in a cage
and brutally beaten?

1078
01:53:08,515 --> 01:53:10,676
You'd be miserable.

1079
01:53:10,884 --> 01:53:14,877
You'd wish to be beaten
instead, right?

1080
01:53:15,288 --> 01:53:21,158
Whenever I see her,
that's how I feel.

1081
01:53:23,329 --> 01:53:25,820
Perhaps you can't
understand her pain.

1082
01:53:28,201 --> 01:53:30,169
But I do.

1083
01:53:30,370 --> 01:53:36,366
No, you only know
that she was a kept woman...

1084
01:53:37,811 --> 01:53:43,113
that it began when she was only a child,
and that it traumatized her.

1085
01:53:43,583 --> 01:53:49,715
But there's more
to her unhappiness than that.

1086
01:53:50,890 --> 01:53:55,486
If you take a piece of candy
from a sensitive child,

1087
01:53:55,695 --> 01:54:01,258
she'll throw a tantrum
and stomp on the candy she has left.

1088
01:54:01,601 --> 01:54:03,796
That's how she is.

1089
01:54:06,573 --> 01:54:08,370
It drives me mad

1090
01:54:08,741 --> 01:54:12,905
to think how things might be
if she weren't like that.

1091
01:54:13,446 --> 01:54:17,405
She thinks her happiness
will always be tainted by that wound,

1092
01:54:17,617 --> 01:54:22,350
so she crushes whatever
happiness comes her way.

1093
01:54:30,363 --> 01:54:33,730
- I can't take it anymore!
- What do you mean?

1094
01:54:35,835 --> 01:54:39,669
Don't you know?
She wrote to me three times.

1095
01:54:40,039 --> 01:54:41,506
Wrote to you?

1096
01:54:43,343 --> 01:54:45,140
Here's one of her letters.

1097
01:54:45,478 --> 01:54:48,038
She insists I marry you.

1098
01:54:48,248 --> 01:54:52,651
She cajoles, entices,
and even pleads with me.

1099
01:54:53,586 --> 01:54:55,451
Last night too.

1100
01:54:55,655 --> 01:54:59,819
Mr. Kayama got
in the way between us,

1101
01:55:00,026 --> 01:55:02,256
and look how she behaved!

1102
01:55:02,462 --> 01:55:05,454
I've never seen
anyone so presumptuous!

1103
01:55:05,665 --> 01:55:08,828
Try to forgive her.
As I said before -

1104
01:55:09,035 --> 01:55:11,469
No, I can't think as you do.

1105
01:55:11,671 --> 01:55:13,730
It's all here in her letter.

1106
01:55:13,940 --> 01:55:18,070
She feigns a stupid sentimentality,
saying she wants to see you happy.

1107
01:55:18,278 --> 01:55:19,245
Don't say that!

1108
01:55:19,445 --> 01:55:22,846
Either that or she's jealous -
or even worse!

1109
01:55:23,049 --> 01:55:26,143
She's not uniting us,
she's dividing us!

1110
01:55:26,352 --> 01:55:30,220
- You can't believe that.
- I certainly do!

1111
01:55:30,423 --> 01:55:32,789
<i>You certainly what?</i>

1112
01:55:37,730 --> 01:55:41,359
Ayako asked me
to meet her there.

1113
01:55:41,901 --> 01:55:45,132
I got there at noon
and then fell asleep.

1114
01:55:45,338 --> 01:55:46,600
You what?

1115
01:55:46,806 --> 01:55:48,774
I fell asleep while waiting.

1116
01:55:48,975 --> 01:55:50,499
Well, I never!

1117
01:55:50,710 --> 01:55:53,372
Just how do you feel
about Ayako?

1118
01:55:54,113 --> 01:55:55,341
Feel about her?

1119
01:55:55,548 --> 01:55:58,779
Do you like her, or what?

1120
01:55:59,552 --> 01:56:01,213
I like her a lot.

1121
01:56:01,421 --> 01:56:04,879
Then how you could
fall asleep is beyond me.

1122
01:56:10,363 --> 01:56:13,025
Fine.
Don't bother to explain.

1123
01:56:14,133 --> 01:56:16,533
But assure me of one thing.

1124
01:56:17,070 --> 01:56:22,599
Did anything happen
that might make a mother worry?

1125
01:56:26,779 --> 01:56:28,747
I don't think so.

1126
01:56:29,382 --> 01:56:35,116
Then you can meet again.
But not outside - she catches cold easily.

1127
01:56:36,389 --> 01:56:39,984
Come visit her
at our home if you wish -

1128
01:56:40,193 --> 01:56:43,185
but come in
through the front door!

1129
01:56:50,103 --> 01:56:53,800
You really are a mystery.

1130
01:56:55,141 --> 01:56:59,100
You suddenly show up...

1131
01:57:00,346 --> 01:57:03,315
during a blizzard
to pay a visit.

1132
01:57:03,783 --> 01:57:07,082
Nothing you do
ever fails to surprise.

1133
01:57:09,622 --> 01:57:15,356
You know how, in late March,
the clouds suddenly part after a blizzard?

1134
01:57:15,561 --> 01:57:18,928
Blue skies,
then a sudden crack of thunder.

1135
01:57:20,767 --> 01:57:23,668
That's exactly how you are.

1136
01:57:29,042 --> 01:57:31,010
I can't stand it!

1137
01:57:32,712 --> 01:57:39,140
You sat with her like this
when you went away.

1138
01:57:40,686 --> 01:57:43,655
And you talked about me,
didn't you?

1139
01:57:45,992 --> 01:57:47,960
Leave right now!

1140
01:57:49,695 --> 01:57:52,163
And never come back!

1141
01:57:53,166 --> 01:57:56,727
I'm like a bride-to-be

1142
01:57:56,936 --> 01:58:01,600
sealed up
and on display in a bottle.

1143
01:58:02,341 --> 01:58:05,606
Then it's straight
from bottle to altar.

1144
01:58:11,951 --> 01:58:13,418
I can't stand it!

1145
01:58:13,619 --> 01:58:16,486
Let's take a trip together!

1146
01:58:19,692 --> 01:58:22,217
Why do you come here
every day?

1147
01:58:22,728 --> 01:58:25,788
Don't you realize
everyone's laughing at you?

1148
01:58:29,569 --> 01:58:33,630
And I'm sick of seeing
your face every day.

1149
01:58:35,675 --> 01:58:41,011
I sometimes say
terrible things to you, don't I?

1150
01:58:42,915 --> 01:58:47,375
Are you going
to hold it against me...

1151
01:58:49,122 --> 01:58:50,919
later on?

1152
01:58:51,624 --> 01:58:56,220
Another letter from her!
It's shameful!

1153
01:58:57,163 --> 01:59:01,099
She says she'll marry
when we do.

1154
01:59:02,101 --> 01:59:04,194
What is it?
You look pale.

1155
01:59:06,205 --> 01:59:08,537
That upsets you, doesn't it?

1156
01:59:10,776 --> 01:59:15,179
Don't worry.
I'd never marry you, no matter what!

1157
01:59:26,325 --> 01:59:28,520
Why are you all laughing
at Mr. Kameda?

1158
01:59:29,495 --> 01:59:33,522
What's so funny about him
bringing me carnations?

1159
01:59:34,367 --> 01:59:37,393
- No one's laughing.
- Liar!

1160
01:59:37,603 --> 01:59:41,300
You deliberately
set them in front of me

1161
01:59:41,507 --> 01:59:44,340
and then smirked
at Mr. Kayama.

1162
01:59:44,544 --> 01:59:47,570
We always put flowers
in the center.

1163
01:59:47,914 --> 01:59:51,111
Calm down.
Don't get upset over nothing.

1164
01:59:51,317 --> 01:59:54,184
It's not nothing to me.

1165
02:00:01,427 --> 02:00:05,887
Mr. Kameda is more noble
than anyone here.

1166
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:09,327
He has a better nature...

1167
02:00:10,903 --> 02:00:13,497
and a purer heart.

1168
02:00:17,810 --> 02:00:22,543
Yet you all
make fun of him!

1169
02:00:24,984 --> 02:00:26,781
And of me too.

1170
02:00:27,186 --> 02:00:28,778
Are you crying?

1171
02:00:28,988 --> 02:00:31,252
No, certainly not.

1172
02:00:33,326 --> 02:00:37,422
But why is it so funny
that he brought me carnations?

1173
02:00:39,498 --> 02:00:41,830
Well, they're red!
It's absurd!

1174
02:00:42,034 --> 02:00:42,966
Why?

1175
02:00:43,603 --> 02:00:45,662
You don't know?

1176
02:00:46,405 --> 02:00:48,464
Red carnations mean -

1177
02:00:49,075 --> 02:00:50,235
Right, Mr. Kayama?

1178
02:00:52,178 --> 02:00:54,146
I'll ask Mr. Kayama.

1179
02:00:54,347 --> 02:00:58,511
Answer me clearly.
What makes red carnations so funny?

1180
02:00:59,885 --> 02:01:04,913
I guess... it's because
red carnations signify love.

1181
02:01:05,124 --> 02:01:10,585
I didn't know that.
I just thought -

1182
02:01:10,796 --> 02:01:12,263
Just a moment.

1183
02:01:13,099 --> 02:01:18,162
Even if he brought them

1184
02:01:18,371 --> 02:01:21,431
knowing full well
what they meant,

1185
02:01:21,907 --> 02:01:24,876
it wouldn't seem funny to me.

1186
02:01:25,378 --> 02:01:28,575
I'd be delighted
and accept them gratefully.

1187
02:01:29,315 --> 02:01:30,782
Ayako!

1188
02:01:34,186 --> 02:01:36,154
What's it matter anyway?

1189
02:01:36,355 --> 02:01:40,519
That language of flowers is foreign.
It doesn't apply in Japan.

1190
02:01:40,726 --> 02:01:43,126
But what if it did?

1191
02:01:45,398 --> 02:01:49,357
He just got through saying
he didn't know.

1192
02:01:49,568 --> 02:01:52,298
Isn't that right?
- Yes.

1193
02:01:52,505 --> 02:01:55,668
But it's true that I love her.

1194
02:01:57,643 --> 02:02:03,081
Well, that could mean a lot of things.
Surely you're not proposing to her!

1195
02:02:03,316 --> 02:02:04,908
I...

1196
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:09,547
I am.

1197
02:02:31,377 --> 02:02:32,969
This is -

1198
02:02:34,113 --> 02:02:36,081
Right, Satoko?

1199
02:02:37,950 --> 02:02:41,386
I won't allow it.
I simply won't.

1200
02:02:46,459 --> 02:02:50,225
I'd like to speak
with him in private.

1201
02:02:56,602 --> 02:03:02,666
We certainly didn't expect this.
How did this come about?

1202
02:03:03,008 --> 02:03:06,239
Father, Mother would like
to see you.

1203
02:03:07,980 --> 02:03:12,417
Wait here and think it over,
all right?

1204
02:03:33,606 --> 02:03:36,404
Look at her.

1205
02:03:36,609 --> 02:03:38,338
The poor child!

1206
02:03:46,452 --> 02:03:48,010
But -

1207
02:03:48,220 --> 02:03:53,783
We have no choice
but to let her follow her heart.

1208
02:03:54,727 --> 02:03:56,957
But of all people!

1209
02:03:57,163 --> 02:04:02,795
I know,
but deep in my heart,

1210
02:04:03,002 --> 02:04:05,994
I feel she's made
the right choice.

1211
02:04:16,649 --> 02:04:18,617
No, don't look.

1212
02:04:23,889 --> 02:04:26,517
You mustn't see
my face right now.

1213
02:04:28,761 --> 02:04:31,924
But what an expression.

1214
02:04:32,131 --> 02:04:34,429
What do you mean?

1215
02:04:34,633 --> 02:04:37,101
I see your reflection
in the window.

1216
02:04:41,774 --> 02:04:46,177
I think I know
why you look so sad.

1217
02:04:46,378 --> 02:04:48,005
You mustn't say it!

1218
02:04:48,414 --> 02:04:51,713
But it needs to be said.

1219
02:04:54,420 --> 02:04:58,948
There's someone
standing between us.

1220
02:04:59,158 --> 02:05:00,853
Don't say it!

1221
02:05:43,269 --> 02:05:46,033
Please get up.

1222
02:05:50,676 --> 02:05:55,579
Are you happy?
That's all I need to know.

1223
02:05:57,683 --> 02:06:01,483
Are you happy?
What did she say?

1224
02:06:04,823 --> 02:06:07,986
I understand.
I'm so glad.

1225
02:06:08,627 --> 02:06:14,395
Then this will be
the last time we meet.

1226
02:06:16,435 --> 02:06:18,369
Farewell.

1227
02:06:29,715 --> 02:06:31,774
We're leaving tomorrow.

1228
02:06:32,451 --> 02:06:35,045
We'll probably
never meet again.

1229
02:06:35,688 --> 02:06:40,387
Why didn't you
answer her question?

1230
02:06:41,193 --> 02:06:43,491
Are you happy or not?

1231
02:06:46,599 --> 02:06:48,430
I see.

1232
02:06:48,867 --> 02:06:50,767
Of course you can't answer.

1233
02:07:09,655 --> 02:07:13,091
<i>We just had an unexpected guest -
Miss Ayako.</i>

1234
02:07:13,559 --> 02:07:15,322
<i>No, not for you.</i>

1235
02:07:15,527 --> 02:07:17,995
You get your hopes up
so easily.

1236
02:07:18,197 --> 02:07:22,031
Last night you seemed pleased
about their engagement.

1237
02:07:22,234 --> 02:07:23,667
She's here to see Kameda?

1238
02:07:23,869 --> 02:07:27,032
You need to ask?
Of course she is.

1239
02:07:27,773 --> 02:07:29,570
What a slap in the face!

1240
02:07:29,775 --> 02:07:33,142
They just went out
together in the storm.

1241
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:37,173
Are you afraid
to take me to her?

1242
02:07:37,383 --> 02:07:39,248
No, but still I'm worried.

1243
02:07:39,451 --> 02:07:42,750
Don't worry.
I just want to see for myself.

1244
02:07:42,955 --> 02:07:46,015
I want to understand her
the way you do.

1245
02:07:46,225 --> 02:07:47,783
No, just listen.

1246
02:07:47,993 --> 02:07:53,021
Last night I thought and thought,
and it finally hit me.

1247
02:07:54,333 --> 02:07:58,360
If I talk to her,
it might clear everything up.

1248
02:08:03,242 --> 02:08:06,439
I may even come to like her.

1249
02:08:44,183 --> 02:08:47,084
- Is she inside?
- Yes.

1250
02:08:47,453 --> 02:08:49,887
But I -

1251
02:09:12,177 --> 02:09:14,805
Frightened of a mere girl?

1252
02:09:19,585 --> 02:09:21,052
Yes, I am.

1253
02:09:23,355 --> 02:09:27,314
I'm afraid to even look at her.

1254
02:09:31,697 --> 02:09:36,566
She's everything
I ever dreamed of being.

1255
02:09:41,373 --> 02:09:43,170
She possesses...

1256
02:09:45,477 --> 02:09:50,437
everything I've ever lost.

1257
02:10:14,106 --> 02:10:16,040
She represents...

1258
02:10:18,110 --> 02:10:21,477
an ideal for me.

1259
02:10:26,785 --> 02:10:28,412
That's why...

1260
02:10:30,422 --> 02:10:32,481
I wrote to her.

1261
02:10:36,562 --> 02:10:38,530
I want her...

1262
02:10:41,600 --> 02:10:44,728
to have the kind of life
I dreamed of.

1263
02:10:54,012 --> 02:10:55,479
But -

1264
02:10:56,782 --> 02:11:01,378
But if you meet her,
you may not like her.

1265
02:11:07,025 --> 02:11:11,121
Please, let's go back.
I'm afraid.

1266
02:11:11,330 --> 02:11:14,163
What's wrong?
Why that look?

1267
02:11:14,766 --> 02:11:16,961
You're pale too.

1268
02:11:19,872 --> 02:11:26,072
This is important for us.

1269
02:11:26,778 --> 02:11:30,305
I won't be impetuous
like I usually am.

1270
02:14:45,477 --> 02:14:51,473
I assume you're fully aware...

1271
02:14:52,884 --> 02:14:57,912
of why I asked to see you.

1272
02:14:59,825 --> 02:15:02,555
No, I'm afraid I'm not.

1273
02:15:04,463 --> 02:15:06,795
Yes, you are.

1274
02:15:08,733 --> 02:15:13,363
What would I possibly gain
by pretending?

1275
02:15:15,273 --> 02:15:17,571
Very well.
Never mind that.

1276
02:15:18,977 --> 02:15:22,708
But there seems to be
a misunderstanding.

1277
02:15:24,349 --> 02:15:27,477
I didn't come here
to quarrel with you...

1278
02:15:28,620 --> 02:15:34,422
but I'm also not the sort
to let things pass unnoticed.

1279
02:15:35,060 --> 02:15:39,292
I came to give you
a reply to your letters.

1280
02:15:42,033 --> 02:15:45,469
But first there's something
I'd like to ask.

1281
02:15:46,037 --> 02:15:49,438
Do you have any idea...

1282
02:15:51,576 --> 02:15:54,101
what sort of person
Mr. Kameda is?

1283
02:15:57,048 --> 02:15:58,606
I certainly do.

1284
02:15:59,584 --> 02:16:02,348
I daresay I know
far better than you.

1285
02:16:04,389 --> 02:16:07,722
That's a lie!
You couldn't possibly know.

1286
02:16:07,926 --> 02:16:08,722
Why not?

1287
02:16:09,661 --> 02:16:11,128
Why not?

1288
02:16:13,899 --> 02:16:17,391
Because you only ever
think of yourself.

1289
02:16:17,602 --> 02:16:19,695
Drunk on your own misery,

1290
02:16:19,905 --> 02:16:23,432
you don't see
the grief you cause others.

1291
02:16:23,642 --> 02:16:26,702
If you really
understood Mr. Kameda,

1292
02:16:26,912 --> 02:16:29,779
you wouldn't subject him
to such ridicule.

1293
02:16:30,749 --> 02:16:35,243
I don't recall ever
subjecting him to ridicule.

1294
02:16:35,520 --> 02:16:38,489
Then why did you
walk out on him?

1295
02:16:38,690 --> 02:16:43,059
He's a simple man.
You deceived and mistreated him.

1296
02:16:43,261 --> 02:16:44,728
Ayako!

1297
02:16:49,801 --> 02:16:51,598
Look at him.

1298
02:16:53,104 --> 02:16:56,096
Even now
he's trying to defend you.

1299
02:17:02,380 --> 02:17:08,341
I've never met a man
with a heart so big and so pure.

1300
02:17:11,790 --> 02:17:16,818
That's why I love him
with all my soul.

1301
02:17:36,915 --> 02:17:41,181
Is that all
you came to say?

1302
02:17:41,453 --> 02:17:44,320
No, there's still
the most important thing:

1303
02:17:44,789 --> 02:17:48,555
My reply
to your obnoxious letters.

1304
02:17:49,227 --> 02:17:51,457
I'll be frank.

1305
02:17:52,097 --> 02:17:55,498
You have no right
to meddle in our affairs.

1306
02:17:55,767 --> 02:17:58,327
Stop coming between us!

1307
02:17:58,737 --> 02:18:01,501
Stop playing the martyr
at our expense!

1308
02:18:01,906 --> 02:18:07,071
<i>You act as if you're
Violetta from La Traviata!</i>

1309
02:18:07,279 --> 02:18:09,304
You mustn't say that!

1310
02:18:26,398 --> 02:18:30,391
You were right.

1311
02:18:31,403 --> 02:18:34,861
How could I have been
such a fool?

1312
02:18:38,543 --> 02:18:42,980
For some reason I imagined
this jealous little princess

1313
02:18:43,181 --> 02:18:47,379
to be some kind of angel.

1314
02:18:54,659 --> 02:18:56,627
Listen to me, young lady.

1315
02:18:57,495 --> 02:19:02,194
You don't even know yourself
why you came here, do you?

1316
02:19:04,336 --> 02:19:06,304
Shall I tell you why?

1317
02:19:06,838 --> 02:19:11,468
You wanted to see
what it is you're afraid of.

1318
02:19:11,676 --> 02:19:13,576
What would I be afraid of?

1319
02:19:13,778 --> 02:19:15,473
Me, of course.

1320
02:19:15,680 --> 02:19:21,277
You're terrified
that he might love me more.

1321
02:19:22,187 --> 02:19:24,052
That's why you're here.

1322
02:19:25,457 --> 02:19:26,924
You're wrong.

1323
02:19:27,125 --> 02:19:31,255
It's pity he feels for you,
not love.

1324
02:19:31,463 --> 02:19:34,955
It amounts to the same thing.

1325
02:19:36,401 --> 02:19:41,600
But I know I have no right
to accept his love.

1326
02:19:43,675 --> 02:19:45,302
That's why I -

1327
02:19:47,512 --> 02:19:49,275
No, enough of this!

1328
02:19:49,714 --> 02:19:53,343
Take your precious man and go!

1329
02:19:54,686 --> 02:19:57,382
I can't bear to look at you.

1330
02:19:57,589 --> 02:20:03,152
But know that you're the one
causing him all this suffering!

1331
02:20:06,064 --> 02:20:08,328
Now go! Take him away!

1332
02:20:08,700 --> 02:20:11,032
Get out of here!

1333
02:20:11,336 --> 02:20:12,860
Now!

1334
02:20:33,792 --> 02:20:36,659
No, I've changed my mind.

1335
02:20:48,773 --> 02:20:52,504
We'll fight for him.
Are you ready?

1336
02:20:53,845 --> 02:20:56,177
I'll command him
to leave you...

1337
02:20:57,282 --> 02:21:02,879
and he'll abandon you
and stay with me forever.

1338
02:21:06,024 --> 02:21:08,219
He'll marry me...

1339
02:21:09,761 --> 02:21:13,026
and you'll go home alone
and in tears.

1340
02:21:14,799 --> 02:21:18,360
Is that what you want?
Is it?

1341
02:21:19,170 --> 02:21:22,970
Mr. Kameda,
which of us will you choose?

1342
02:21:23,475 --> 02:21:26,911
No, I'll never
let you go again.

1343
02:21:27,412 --> 02:21:30,074
Say you'll marry me!

1344
02:21:30,281 --> 02:21:32,078
Please, don't do this!

1345
02:21:32,951 --> 02:21:35,044
Are you ready?

1346
02:21:37,055 --> 02:21:43,517
If he refuses to take my hand
and say he's leaving you,

1347
02:21:43,728 --> 02:21:45,753
then you win.

1348
02:21:46,364 --> 02:21:51,427
In that case, you can take him away.
I have no need of him.

1349
02:21:53,137 --> 02:21:58,632
Now then:
Which of us will it be?

1350
02:23:02,840 --> 02:23:05,070
How did it ever come to this?

1351
02:23:12,584 --> 02:23:15,985
Please, please...

1352
02:23:17,155 --> 02:23:19,419
you mustn't blame her.

1353
02:23:22,126 --> 02:23:24,060
She's so...

1354
02:23:25,563 --> 02:23:28,225
deeply unhappy.

1355
02:23:42,947 --> 02:23:45,108
Are you going after her?

1356
02:23:46,417 --> 02:23:48,681
Are you?

1357
02:24:22,854 --> 02:24:25,322
I'll take care of things here.

1358
02:24:26,958 --> 02:24:29,119
You go after Ayako.

1359
02:25:08,099 --> 02:25:10,260
Ayako hasn't come home!

1360
02:25:10,501 --> 02:25:15,234
You took her to see that woman
and didn't escort her home

1361
02:25:15,440 --> 02:25:17,408
in this blizzard!

1362
02:25:28,453 --> 02:25:29,681
Please hurry!

1363
02:25:29,887 --> 02:25:33,823
Ayako came to our house
with a raging fever.

1364
02:25:34,025 --> 02:25:36,755
I ran here because
the phone wasn't working.

1365
02:25:36,961 --> 02:25:39,429
We'll be right there!

1366
02:25:44,068 --> 02:25:45,626
Listen here:

1367
02:25:45,837 --> 02:25:49,898
It's all over.
I've had enough of you.

1368
02:26:27,545 --> 02:26:30,446
AKAMA RESIDENCE

1369
02:27:02,113 --> 02:27:04,138
Come with me.

1370
02:27:05,349 --> 02:27:07,249
I have to talk to you.

1371
02:27:18,062 --> 02:27:20,428
Is she at your place?

1372
02:27:21,032 --> 02:27:22,499
Yes.

1373
02:27:22,800 --> 02:27:28,363
Was that you peeking out at me?
Has she been there all this time?

1374
02:27:28,706 --> 02:27:31,504
I told you:
Don't walk so close to me.

1375
02:28:14,752 --> 02:28:16,879
Remember:
You never saw me here.

1376
02:30:04,295 --> 02:30:05,990
It's very cold.

1377
02:30:07,465 --> 02:30:09,456
Won't you light the stove?

1378
02:30:11,602 --> 02:30:13,229
No, I can't.

1379
02:30:13,504 --> 02:30:14,971
Why not?

1380
02:30:17,441 --> 02:30:21,309
I had to see you,
no matter what.

1381
02:30:22,046 --> 02:30:24,514
Really?
So I was right.

1382
02:30:25,750 --> 02:30:30,744
I got that feeling somehow,
so I came looking for you.

1383
02:30:53,544 --> 02:30:58,038
You've been on my mind a lot.

1384
02:30:58,516 --> 02:31:03,283
I thought I'd bring you here
so we could talk through the night.

1385
02:31:14,632 --> 02:31:18,625
Is she asleep in there?

1386
02:31:29,647 --> 02:31:31,410
That's right.

1387
02:31:33,250 --> 02:31:35,013
Want to look?

1388
02:32:18,496 --> 02:32:19,929
Listen -

1389
02:32:21,765 --> 02:32:24,165
No, never mind.
Go in.

1390
02:32:35,212 --> 02:32:37,840
It's so dark here.

1391
02:32:38,282 --> 02:32:40,216
You'll see enough.

1392
02:33:06,010 --> 02:33:08,274
You're trembling like a leaf.

1393
02:33:08,479 --> 02:33:11,039
Careful you don't have
another fit.

1394
02:33:32,736 --> 02:33:36,695
Did you... do that?

1395
02:33:37,708 --> 02:33:39,175
Yes.

1396
02:33:48,152 --> 02:33:52,680
What do you intend
to do now?

1397
02:33:53,591 --> 02:33:57,254
I don't get it.
Why are you trembling like that?

1398
02:34:00,397 --> 02:34:03,127
Anyway, let's spend
the night here.

1399
02:34:06,704 --> 02:34:08,604
I'm hot.

1400
02:34:09,540 --> 02:34:11,565
It's hot, isn't it?

1401
02:34:13,010 --> 02:34:16,411
What?
I thought you were cold.

1402
02:34:22,386 --> 02:34:26,152
Listen! Do you hear
someone in the hall?

1403
02:34:28,859 --> 02:34:31,521
I don't hear anything.

1404
02:34:46,443 --> 02:34:49,469
You see?
She's sleeping in there.

1405
02:34:50,781 --> 02:34:53,079
She's not going anywhere.

1406
02:34:54,485 --> 02:34:56,646
She's all ours now.

1407
02:35:13,804 --> 02:35:17,763
We won't let some worthless fool
take her, will we?

1408
02:35:22,146 --> 02:35:24,671
Let's take turns keeping watch.

1409
02:35:33,357 --> 02:35:35,587
She has a beautiful body!

1410
02:35:35,793 --> 02:35:37,818
Take a look in the morning.

1411
02:35:40,764 --> 02:35:43,790
I spent all day by her side.

1412
02:35:45,169 --> 02:35:47,729
I've never seen
such a beautiful woman.

1413
02:35:56,213 --> 02:35:59,376
But I'm worried
she may start to smell.

1414
02:36:00,050 --> 02:36:02,746
The stove was lit earlier.

1415
02:36:05,756 --> 02:36:07,348
You smell anything?

1416
02:36:10,327 --> 02:36:12,921
I don't think so.

1417
02:36:15,899 --> 02:36:20,461
I wish we had
flowers to offer.

1418
02:36:23,273 --> 02:36:26,106
Mother always has some
on the family altar,

1419
02:36:26,443 --> 02:36:29,412
but she'd notice
if any were missing.

1420
02:36:30,981 --> 02:36:33,040
Shall I go buy some?

1421
02:36:36,920 --> 02:36:40,253
Let's bury her
in lots of different flowers.

1422
02:36:43,394 --> 02:36:47,831
No, that would be too sad.

1423
02:37:03,947 --> 02:37:07,508
Oh, right!
There's something I wanted to ask.

1424
02:37:09,553 --> 02:37:13,421
How did you kill her?

1425
02:37:13,891 --> 02:37:15,916
Did you use that knife?

1426
02:37:16,126 --> 02:37:18,287
Yes, the butcher's knife.

1427
02:37:18,495 --> 02:37:20,156
Wait a minute.

1428
02:37:23,567 --> 02:37:26,764
There are other things
I want to ask.

1429
02:37:27,137 --> 02:37:28,764
Lots of things.

1430
02:37:29,440 --> 02:37:31,431
Tell me everything.

1431
02:37:33,410 --> 02:37:38,313
I went rushing off, right?

1432
02:37:39,983 --> 02:37:42,076
Is that when you did it?

1433
02:37:42,519 --> 02:37:46,546
Right after that.
The knife was on the desk.

1434
02:37:52,963 --> 02:37:55,488
But something puzzles me.

1435
02:37:55,699 --> 02:37:59,601
It went in three inches -
no, even deeper -

1436
02:38:00,771 --> 02:38:03,865
right around here...

1437
02:38:04,908 --> 02:38:08,571
but hardly any blood came out.

1438
02:38:09,279 --> 02:38:10,803
You know why?

1439
02:38:11,815 --> 02:38:13,942
I can explain that.

1440
02:38:16,820 --> 02:38:19,311
It's called internal bleeding.

1441
02:38:34,972 --> 02:38:36,269
Listen!

1442
02:38:38,208 --> 02:38:39,835
You hear that?

1443
02:38:40,878 --> 02:38:42,345
Yes!

1444
02:38:43,947 --> 02:38:45,574
Footsteps!

1445
02:38:47,451 --> 02:38:51,512
You hear that?
Someone's outside.

1446
02:38:51,822 --> 02:38:53,449
I hear it.

1447
02:38:54,391 --> 02:38:56,382
Someone's walking around.

1448
02:38:56,593 --> 02:38:58,220
That's right.

1449
02:39:58,455 --> 02:40:00,616
Amazing!

1450
02:40:00,891 --> 02:40:03,121
Look at that cloud!

1451
02:40:21,612 --> 02:40:23,580
It's like a rainbow.

1452
02:40:31,555 --> 02:40:33,887
Look how strangely it shines!

1453
02:40:38,395 --> 02:40:41,831
It's coming this way!
It's coming!

1454
02:40:42,199 --> 02:40:44,167
It's racing toward us.

1455
02:40:45,869 --> 02:40:48,963
And she's riding on it!

1456
02:40:52,142 --> 02:40:54,110
She's laughing!

1457
02:40:57,080 --> 02:40:59,048
Mother's there too.

1458
02:41:03,253 --> 02:41:05,551
They're here!

1459
02:41:08,392 --> 02:41:11,691
Hurry, get on!

1460
02:43:13,650 --> 02:43:15,880
<i>Someone come quickly!</i>

1461
02:43:27,297 --> 02:43:30,824
You hear that thunder?
Even the weather's gone crazy.

1462
02:43:31,034 --> 02:43:33,559
I hate having
to visit the sick.

1463
02:43:33,770 --> 02:43:37,570
Ayako, do something for him.
He's terrified.

1464
02:43:37,774 --> 02:43:39,401
I told him not to come.

1465
02:43:39,609 --> 02:43:42,077
And he's in middle school, no less.

1466
02:43:42,279 --> 02:43:44,338
What could be so frightening
about that idiot?

1467
02:44:05,602 --> 02:44:08,537
Kaoru, come with me.

1468
02:44:45,942 --> 02:44:50,345
Poor thing.
I feel so sorry for him.

1469
02:44:52,649 --> 02:44:57,211
No matter what anyone says,
he was a fine person.

1470
02:44:57,621 --> 02:45:00,920
He was too good
for this world.

1471
02:45:01,524 --> 02:45:07,463
Even that worthless Karube came,
flowers in hand.

1472
02:45:10,400 --> 02:45:13,096
He actually had
tears in his eyes.

1473
02:45:24,147 --> 02:45:28,481
I don't want to talk about it.

1474
02:45:29,786 --> 02:45:32,914
I promised you...

1475
02:45:33,890 --> 02:45:39,385
I'd keep an eye on him
and tell you what he was doing.

1476
02:45:39,596 --> 02:45:41,393
But it was too -

1477
02:45:42,933 --> 02:45:44,764
Was it that awful?

1478
02:45:47,771 --> 02:45:50,934
All I know

1479
02:45:51,141 --> 02:45:55,339
is that I'll remember
what a good man he was.

1480
02:45:59,215 --> 02:46:04,084
If only we could all
love as he did...

1481
02:46:04,955 --> 02:46:07,082
without hatred.

1482
02:46:07,824 --> 02:46:11,954
What a fool I've been.

1483
02:46:13,797 --> 02:46:16,265
I was the idiot.

1484
02:46:32,449 --> 02:46:35,782
THE END

1485
02:46:37,320 --> 02:46:41,279
